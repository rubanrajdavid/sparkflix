WEBVTT

00:00:56.673 --> 00:01:00.675
It's obviously a
major malfunction.

00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:18.485
...their President is a
crook. Well, I'm not a crook.

00:01:22.405 --> 00:01:26.202
Robert Kennedy was
shot in that ballroom.

00:01:28.744 --> 00:01:31.162
Thank God Almighty,
we are free at last!

00:01:31.455 --> 00:01:34.293
A sniper has fired
at President Kennedy.

00:01:41.964 --> 00:01:46.135
Or have you ever been a
member of the Communist party?

00:01:50.472 --> 00:01:52.558
Hi-yo, Silver!

00:01:57.437 --> 00:01:59.187
...1941...

00:01:59.774 --> 00:02:03.109
...a date which
will live in infamy.

00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:09.439
We bring you the
final edition of

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.700
our Maxwell House
Good News of 1939.

00:02:12.034 --> 00:02:13.775
Good evening,
Mr. and Mrs. North

00:02:13.776 --> 00:02:15.620
America, and all
the ships at sea.

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:25.087
The only thing we have
to fear is fear itself.

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:33.610
CQ...

00:03:33.983 --> 00:03:35.986
...this is W-9 GFO.

00:03:38.237 --> 00:03:41.616
CQ, this is W-9
GFO here. Come back?

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.745
CQ...

00:03:46.953 --> 00:03:49.582
...this is W-9 GFO here.

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.667
Come back?

00:03:55.588 --> 00:03:59.758
CQ, this is W-9 GFO.
Is anybody out there?

00:04:00.801 --> 00:04:01.926
Not getting anything.

00:04:02.218 --> 00:04:03.719
Small moves, Ellie.

00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:06.514
Small moves.

00:04:09.142 --> 00:04:12.893
CQ, this is W-9
GFO here. Come back?

00:04:13.854 --> 00:04:15.481
Copy, W-9 GFO.

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.566
K-4 WLD here.

00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:19.400
What do I say?

00:04:19.608 --> 00:04:21.067
Just be yourself.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.238
Where are you,
K-4 WLD? Come back?

00:04:24.447 --> 00:04:25.740
Pensacola. Over.

00:04:25.989 --> 00:04:27.575
Pensacola, where's Pensacola?

00:04:27.908 --> 00:04:29.367
I'll give you a hint.

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:31.204
Orange juice.

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.666
Copy that, K-4 WLD. How's the
weather down there in Florida?

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.878
Pensacola, Florida.

00:04:41.546 --> 00:04:43.382
I have to tell you, Sparks.

00:04:44.257 --> 00:04:46.552
1,116 miles.

00:04:48.094 --> 00:04:49.219
Pretty good.

00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:51.053
That's the farthest yet.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.776
Can we hear all
the way to New York?

00:05:06.027 --> 00:05:07.236
Sure.

00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:10.612
Can we hear all the
way to California?

00:05:10.863 --> 00:05:12.576
I don't see why not.

00:05:13.325 --> 00:05:15.326
Can we hear all
the way to Alaska?

00:05:15.703 --> 00:05:17.037
On a really clear day.

00:05:17.245 --> 00:05:19.247
Can we hear all
the way to China?

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.751
On a really, really clear day.

00:05:24.586 --> 00:05:26.795
Could we talk to the moon?

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.256
If it's a big enough
radio, I don't see why not.

00:05:30.923 --> 00:05:32.926
Could we talk to Jupiter?

00:05:33.134 --> 00:05:35.636
Or what's the one after that?

00:05:36.094 --> 00:05:37.389
Don't tell me.

00:05:39.807 --> 00:05:41.141
I'll give you a hint.

00:05:41.601 --> 00:05:42.768
Hula-Hoops.

00:05:42.977 --> 00:05:44.980
Saturn! Could we
talk to Saturn?

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.156
Dad, could we talk to Mom?

00:05:58.784 --> 00:06:02.037
I don't think even the biggest
radio could reach that far.

00:06:07.042 --> 00:06:08.876
All right, no more stalling.

00:06:13.838 --> 00:06:15.298
Pensacola!

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:24.391
That's a beauty.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.310
Now get some sleep.

00:06:35.652 --> 00:06:36.943
Hey, Dad?

00:06:38.028 --> 00:06:40.655
Do you think there's
people on other planets?

00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:42.533
I don't know, Sparks.

00:06:44.034 --> 00:06:45.662
But I guess I'd say...

00:06:46.201 --> 00:06:48.037
...if it is just us...

00:06:49.621 --> 00:06:51.874
...it seems like an
awful waste of space.

00:07:11.516 --> 00:07:13.894
CQ, this is W-9 GFO.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.691
Repeat. This is
W-9 GFO. Come back?

00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:26.740
I'm going to need
a bigger antenna.

00:07:53.764 --> 00:07:55.390
What do you think, Doc Arroway?

00:07:55.599 --> 00:07:57.098
Isn't she a beauty?

00:08:01.228 --> 00:08:02.355
It'll do.

00:08:02.563 --> 00:08:04.524
The village is five miles away.

00:08:04.732 --> 00:08:07.016
There's a general
store in the cantina.

00:08:07.016 --> 00:08:09.238
They can order
anything from San Juan.

00:08:09.445 --> 00:08:10.946
When can I get dish time?

00:08:11.113 --> 00:08:12.667
Dr. Clark said you couldn't

00:08:12.668 --> 00:08:14.740
wait. Your first
shift is tonight.

00:09:10.835 --> 00:09:12.001
Go back.

00:09:13.964 --> 00:09:16.674
Try back a little bit.
You had something there.

00:09:18.008 --> 00:09:19.009
There!

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.175
- Right there?

00:09:20.175 --> 00:09:22.554
- You hear it? Right
there, that's it.

00:09:22.847 --> 00:09:26.516
All right, 1221.46. That's
well within the L-band.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:27.807
Check off-axis.

00:09:28.851 --> 00:09:29.976
On it.

00:09:31.688 --> 00:09:33.188
It's not in the neighborhood.

00:09:42.029 --> 00:09:44.032
Here it is. J-1741...

00:09:44.324 --> 00:09:45.991
...+ 2748.

00:09:46.199 --> 00:09:49.370
Catalogued November
4, 1982. Pulsar.

00:09:52.038 --> 00:09:55.165
Must've been the glitch in
the timing's what threw me.

00:09:55.418 --> 00:09:57.044
Must've been a starquake.

00:09:58.419 --> 00:10:00.073
I think it's great that you

00:10:00.075 --> 00:10:02.339
listen. Most don't
do that anymore.

00:10:02.548 --> 00:10:05.344
It's just an old habit.
It makes it feel more real.

00:10:05.552 --> 00:10:06.469
Ellie.

00:10:06.677 --> 00:10:07.845
Kent Clark.

00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:12.351
They said you'd been...

00:10:12.558 --> 00:10:15.018
...up at Owen's Valley
working under Drumlin.

00:10:15.186 --> 00:10:16.562
How'd you like him?

00:10:19.773 --> 00:10:21.748
That much? About
what I'd expect

00:10:21.749 --> 00:10:23.901
after what he had
to say about you.

00:10:24.235 --> 00:10:25.861
And what was that?

00:10:26.403 --> 00:10:27.904
That you are brilliant...

00:10:28.195 --> 00:10:29.406
...driven...

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.242
...a major pain in the ass...

00:10:31.574 --> 00:10:32.948
...and obsessed with a field of

00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:34.452
study he considers
tantamount...

00:10:34.618 --> 00:10:36.037
...to professional suicide.

00:10:36.745 --> 00:10:37.747
Anything else?

00:10:37.957 --> 00:10:39.708
Those were the highlights.

00:10:40.249 --> 00:10:42.710
Davio, Dr. Vernon. Dr. Arroway.

00:10:44.252 --> 00:10:46.508
Believe you've already
met our tireless

00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:48.423
research assistant,
Mr. Fisher...

00:10:49.132 --> 00:10:51.426
...as well as his cologne.

00:10:52.094 --> 00:10:54.429
Brook's looking at
the black hole in M-87.

00:10:54.597 --> 00:10:58.434
Eli's studying Markarian
541, a major gamma ray source.

00:10:58.767 --> 00:11:00.830
Dr. Arroway will
be spending her

00:11:00.832 --> 00:11:03.396
precious telescope
time listening for...

00:11:04.145 --> 00:11:06.106
...listening for...

00:11:06.315 --> 00:11:07.817
Little green men.

00:11:15.865 --> 00:11:17.199
One down...

00:11:17.741 --> 00:11:19.451
...a couple billion to go.

00:11:36.259 --> 00:11:38.096
Arecibo, right?

00:11:39.262 --> 00:11:40.431
Does it show?

00:11:42.556 --> 00:11:43.724
Cracker Jack?

00:11:43.934 --> 00:11:44.726
No, thanks.

00:11:44.933 --> 00:11:46.227
Mind if I sit down?

00:11:48.145 --> 00:11:52.063
I hear the locals, they
call it "El Radar. "

00:11:52.275 --> 00:11:54.900
Convinced it has some
dark military purpose.

00:11:55.319 --> 00:11:56.736
I think we're harmless.

00:11:58.195 --> 00:11:59.362
Palmer Joss.

00:12:00.155 --> 00:12:02.658
- Ellie Arroway.
- Nice to meet you, Ellie.

00:12:03.826 --> 00:12:06.619
What are you studying up there?

00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:09.791
The usual.

00:12:09.999 --> 00:12:13.794
Nebulae, quasars,
pulsars, stuff like that.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:15.670
What are you writing?

00:12:16.003 --> 00:12:18.174
The usual. Nouns, adverbs...

00:12:18.382 --> 00:12:19.925
...adjective here and there.

00:12:21.676 --> 00:12:23.218
I work on a project, SETI.

00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:26.014
Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence?

00:12:28.182 --> 00:12:29.850
That is out there!

00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:33.395
Are you a student or something?

00:12:33.894 --> 00:12:36.023
I'm a writer. I'm
writing a book.

00:12:36.565 --> 00:12:38.645
I'm here doing
research about how

00:12:38.646 --> 00:12:41.151
technology affects
Third World cultures.

00:12:41.401 --> 00:12:44.030
I'm also looking for
this guy, David Drumlin.

00:12:44.363 --> 00:12:46.437
He's head of the
National Science

00:12:46.438 --> 00:12:48.451
Foundation. I
want an interview.

00:12:49.701 --> 00:12:51.454
I take it you know him?

00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:54.373
You could say that.

00:12:55.707 --> 00:12:57.208
SETI.

00:12:57.416 --> 00:12:59.087
That's fringe!

00:12:59.504 --> 00:13:01.801
I've crossed paths
with him. Something

00:13:01.802 --> 00:13:03.924
like that must
really chap his ass.

00:13:06.883 --> 00:13:07.927
Compass.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.221
That's for you.

00:13:16.102 --> 00:13:17.560
You better keep this.

00:13:18.768 --> 00:13:20.437
Might save your life someday.

00:13:25.235 --> 00:13:26.819
Have dinner with me tonight?

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.074
I don't make a good research
subject. I'm not quotable.

00:13:33.409 --> 00:13:35.703
No quotes. Scout's honor.

00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:37.413
Good meal, good company.

00:13:38.286 --> 00:13:39.580
I've got to go.

00:13:48.754 --> 00:13:50.549
Drumlin's coming in Tuesday.

00:13:59.473 --> 00:14:02.810
Now I remember why
I took that desk job.

00:14:04.351 --> 00:14:06.356
Dr. Drumlin, how are you?

00:14:07.939 --> 00:14:09.483
Glad you could make it.

00:14:10.651 --> 00:14:13.612
If I'd known it took 3 planes,
I might've reconsidered.

00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:15.156
How is that new office?

00:14:15.364 --> 00:14:17.609
Still settling in.
They already want

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.034
to give half my
budget to the Pentagon.

00:14:20.785 --> 00:14:23.163
Still waiting for E.T. to call?

00:14:25.165 --> 00:14:26.791
Good to see you too!

00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:28.334
Asshole!

00:14:28.584 --> 00:14:30.793
Looks like it's going
to be a long night.

00:14:31.004 --> 00:14:33.274
Science must be
accountable to the

00:14:33.275 --> 00:14:35.673
people paying for
it, the taxpayers.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.133
We must stop wasting money on
pie-in-the-sky abstractions...

00:14:39.303 --> 00:14:42.137
...and spend it on
practical, measurable ways...

00:14:42.304 --> 00:14:45.015
...to improve the lives of
the people who are paying.

00:14:45.181 --> 00:14:48.394
Not unlike my L-band,
globular clusters work.

00:14:48.645 --> 00:14:51.605
You want to do away with
all pure research now?

00:14:51.813 --> 00:14:55.192
What's wrong with science being
practical? Even profitable?

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:57.527
Nothing, as long
as your motive...

00:14:57.819 --> 00:14:59.728
...is the search
for truth. Which

00:14:59.729 --> 00:15:01.697
is what the pursuit
of science is.

00:15:04.327 --> 00:15:06.704
That's an interesting
position from a man...

00:15:06.911 --> 00:15:09.538
...on a crusade against
the evils of technology...

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:10.956
...Father Joss.

00:15:11.623 --> 00:15:14.959
I'm not against technology,
Doctor. I'm against...

00:15:15.169 --> 00:15:18.420
...the men who deify it at
the expense of human truth.

00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:25.885
Kent, I need to have a word
with you. Over here, please.

00:15:31.557 --> 00:15:34.687
You think that hurt my
chances with that interview?

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.729
You're a priest?

00:15:38.649 --> 00:15:39.817
Not really.

00:15:40.566 --> 00:15:43.319
I got my Masters in Divinity...

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.239
...then left the seminary to
do secular humanitarian work...

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.908
...coordinating
Third World churches.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.703
I couldn't live with
the celibacy thing.

00:15:57.331 --> 00:15:59.375
You could call me
a man of the cloth...

00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:02.210
...without the cloth.

00:16:05.588 --> 00:16:07.174
You want to get out of here?

00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:11.095
You see that large W-shaped

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:14.014
constellation there?
That's Cassiopeia.

00:16:14.431 --> 00:16:18.852
And Cassiopeia A gives off
a whole lot of radio signals.

00:16:19.183 --> 00:16:20.854
I listen to them a lot.

00:16:21.104 --> 00:16:23.398
It's a remnant of a supernova.

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:27.026
When did you know you
wanted to be an astronomer?

00:16:29.404 --> 00:16:31.656
When I was about
eight years old...

00:16:31.864 --> 00:16:34.291
...watching the
sunset, I asked Dad,

00:16:34.292 --> 00:16:36.784
"What's that bright
star over there?"

00:16:40.245 --> 00:16:43.374
He said that it wasn't
a star. It was...

00:16:45.293 --> 00:16:47.711
...a whole planet
called Venus...

00:16:51.338 --> 00:16:54.551
...which should
be over there soon.

00:16:55.552 --> 00:16:57.929
He said, "You know why
they called it Venus?

00:16:58.388 --> 00:17:01.601
Because they thought it was
so beautiful and glowing.

00:17:01.891 --> 00:17:03.434
But they didn't know...

00:17:04.143 --> 00:17:06.770
...that it's filled with...

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.399
...deadly gases and
sulfuric acid rain. "

00:17:12.735 --> 00:17:16.237
Wow, I thought, "This
is it! I'm hooked!"

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:22.117
There are four hundred
billion stars out there...

00:17:22.409 --> 00:17:24.243
...just in our galaxy alone.

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:28.915
If only one out of a million
of those had planets...

00:17:29.333 --> 00:17:32.461
...if just one out of a
million of those had life...

00:17:32.627 --> 00:17:34.806
...and if just one
out of a million

00:17:34.807 --> 00:17:36.798
of those had
intelligent life...

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.100
...there would be
literally millions

00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:42.135
of civilizations out there...

00:17:44.055 --> 00:17:45.597
If there wasn't...

00:17:46.515 --> 00:17:48.685
...it'd be an awful
waste of space.

00:17:54.607 --> 00:17:55.816
Amen.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.702
So I was lying there,
just looking at the sky.

00:18:12.622 --> 00:18:15.624
And then I felt
something. I don't know.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.628
All I know is that
I wasn't alone.

00:18:20.005 --> 00:18:24.215
For the first time in my life
I wasn't scared of nothing...

00:18:25.177 --> 00:18:26.761
...not even dying.

00:18:32.391 --> 00:18:34.183
It was God.

00:18:36.937 --> 00:18:38.896
And there's no chance that...

00:18:39.398 --> 00:18:41.517
...you had this
experience because

00:18:41.518 --> 00:18:43.692
some part of you
needed to have it?

00:18:44.901 --> 00:18:48.362
I'm a reasonably
intelligent guy, but this...

00:18:51.242 --> 00:18:54.910
My intellect couldn't
even touch this.

00:18:55.454 --> 00:18:56.413
No.

00:18:58.916 --> 00:19:01.543
I've been to Sunday
school a few times.

00:19:03.753 --> 00:19:04.628
And?

00:19:04.836 --> 00:19:09.382
I kept asking all these really
annoying questions like...

00:19:10.301 --> 00:19:12.720
..."Where did Mrs.
Cain come from?"

00:19:14.678 --> 00:19:17.016
And pretty soon
they asked my dad...

00:19:17.183 --> 00:19:19.976
...if he wouldn't mind
keeping me home from now on.

00:19:20.185 --> 00:19:21.518
Your dad...

00:19:23.188 --> 00:19:24.772
Is it this guy?

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.147
Yeah.

00:19:28.275 --> 00:19:30.276
You're close to
him, aren't you?

00:19:31.655 --> 00:19:34.739
I was. He died when
I was nine years old.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.909
I never got to know my mother.

00:19:40.578 --> 00:19:41.871
I'm sorry.

00:19:46.416 --> 00:19:48.337
That's got to be tough.

00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:54.424
Being alone.

00:20:03.307 --> 00:20:04.557
What do you say...

00:20:04.808 --> 00:20:08.271
...we pack a picnic tomorrow
and hike up to Mount Arecibo?

00:20:09.144 --> 00:20:12.148
I don't think I can.
I've got to work.

00:20:13.941 --> 00:20:17.361
How about dinner tomorrow
night? I know a great dive.

00:20:17.779 --> 00:20:19.321
No, I don't think so.

00:20:23.994 --> 00:20:26.160
Ellie, did I miss something?

00:20:28.329 --> 00:20:29.456
No.

00:20:29.663 --> 00:20:31.501
Shit, I'm late!

00:20:32.502 --> 00:20:35.379
I told Kent that I'd
be there at 10:30.

00:20:38.046 --> 00:20:39.842
I'm not trying to push you.

00:20:40.049 --> 00:20:42.303
I've wanted to look at
this sector for weeks.

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.177
Just hang out...

00:20:44.512 --> 00:20:47.472
...and sleep in. There's
food in the fridge.

00:20:49.183 --> 00:20:50.267
How can I reach you?

00:20:51.892 --> 00:20:54.145
Just leave your
number. I'll call you.

00:21:15.957 --> 00:21:16.915
Dad!

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.504
It's starting, you're
going to miss it!

00:21:25.091 --> 00:21:27.301
Dad, there's another
one! Hurry up!

00:21:27.468 --> 00:21:29.845
In a minute, Sparks!
I'm almost done.

00:21:30.095 --> 00:21:32.555
There's another one.
Come on, hurry up, Dad!

00:22:28.232 --> 00:22:29.401
I'll get the medicine.

00:23:49.137 --> 00:23:51.851
I know it's hard to
understand this now...

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:55.153
...but we aren't
always meant to know

00:23:55.154 --> 00:23:57.313
why things happen
the way they do.

00:23:57.855 --> 00:24:00.151
Sometimes, we just
have to accept it...

00:24:00.359 --> 00:24:02.193
...as God's will.

00:24:04.153 --> 00:24:07.324
I should have kept medicine
in the downstairs bathroom.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:10.201
Then I could've
gotten to it sooner.

00:24:36.058 --> 00:24:37.391
CQ...

00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:41.562
...this is W-9
GFO. Do you copy?

00:24:45.191 --> 00:24:47.484
Dad, this is Ellie. Come back.

00:24:50.904 --> 00:24:52.823
This is Eleanor Arroway...

00:24:53.073 --> 00:24:56.075
...transmitting
on 14.2 megahertz.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.248
Are you there?

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.836
Come back.

00:25:14.593 --> 00:25:16.011
Are you there?

00:25:17.095 --> 00:25:18.972
Dad, this is Ellie.

00:25:51.543 --> 00:25:54.462
Hi, Kent. What are
you doing up so early?

00:25:55.587 --> 00:25:56.925
I was thinking...

00:25:57.798 --> 00:25:59.800
...we'd make a
pretty good team.

00:26:00.468 --> 00:26:04.056
We could put together
an ad hoc SETI program.

00:26:04.265 --> 00:26:06.557
You know the Very Large
Array in New Mexico?

00:26:06.806 --> 00:26:09.101
It's a dynamite place
to do SETI work...

00:26:09.309 --> 00:26:11.101
What are you talking about?

00:26:13.522 --> 00:26:15.273
Drumlin pulled the plug.

00:26:16.025 --> 00:26:17.025
We're homeless.

00:26:31.329 --> 00:26:32.956
It's true, you pulled the plug?

00:26:33.164 --> 00:26:35.707
You can't see it now,
but I'm doing you a favor.

00:26:35.915 --> 00:26:37.948
You're too promising
a scientist to

00:26:37.949 --> 00:26:39.922
waste your gifts
on this nonsense.

00:26:40.171 --> 00:26:42.172
I don't consider
what could be...

00:26:42.382 --> 00:26:45.217
...the most important
human discovery nonsense!

00:26:45.508 --> 00:26:46.844
400 billion stars...

00:26:47.096 --> 00:26:50.013
And two probabilities. One,
there's intelligent life...

00:26:50.222 --> 00:26:52.639
...but too far away to
contact in your lifetime.

00:26:53.349 --> 00:26:55.268
- And two!
- You're making a decision...

00:26:55.727 --> 00:26:57.850
There's nothing
but gases and carbon

00:26:57.851 --> 00:27:00.148
compounds and you're
wasting your time!

00:27:00.357 --> 00:27:03.317
In the meantime, you
won't be taken seriously.

00:27:03.526 --> 00:27:05.193
Your career will be over!

00:27:05.402 --> 00:27:06.611
So what?

00:27:06.903 --> 00:27:08.320
It's my life!

00:27:46.064 --> 00:27:48.567
Hey, Kent. You were right.

00:27:48.941 --> 00:27:50.849
Screw Drumlin.
We'll raise the money

00:27:50.851 --> 00:27:52.656
ourselves. We'll
go to New Mexico.

00:27:52.906 --> 00:27:55.198
Chicago's set. Let
me know how it goes.

00:27:55.448 --> 00:27:58.365
I've got more corporate stops
on the East Coast for you.

00:27:58.575 --> 00:28:01.705
Did that investor from
Houston ever get back to us?

00:28:01.871 --> 00:28:03.872
I'll hit him up
on my way to L.A.

00:28:04.081 --> 00:28:06.249
Beg for some of
that Hollywood money!

00:28:06.459 --> 00:28:09.546
They've been making money
off aliens for years.

00:28:10.171 --> 00:28:12.797
- Begging is good for the soul.
- We'll see.

00:28:13.173 --> 00:28:14.799
Just do me a favor.

00:28:15.173 --> 00:28:17.634
Try not to be too...
confrontational.

00:28:18.137 --> 00:28:20.430
Confrontational?
Me? What do you mean?

00:28:20.638 --> 00:28:22.265
I'll see if I left anything.

00:28:55.587 --> 00:28:57.477
It's a unique time
in our history,

00:28:57.478 --> 00:28:59.425
in the history of
any civilization.

00:28:59.592 --> 00:29:02.384
It's the moment of the
acquisition of technology.

00:29:02.552 --> 00:29:05.428
That's the moment where
contact becomes possible.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.472
The Very Large Array
in New Mexico...

00:29:08.723 --> 00:29:10.975
...is the key to our
chances for success.

00:29:11.183 --> 00:29:13.270
With its 27 linked
radio telescopes...

00:29:13.519 --> 00:29:15.438
...we can search
more accurately

00:29:15.439 --> 00:29:17.065
than at any other facility.

00:29:17.231 --> 00:29:19.485
We've gotten
approval to buy the

00:29:19.487 --> 00:29:21.943
telescope time
from the government.

00:29:22.819 --> 00:29:24.989
Now all we really
need is the money.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.741
A nice presentation, Doctor.

00:29:28.449 --> 00:29:31.451
But while our foundation arm
has a mandate to support...

00:29:31.661 --> 00:29:34.748
...experimental
programs, your proposal...

00:29:34.998 --> 00:29:39.002
...seems less like science,
and more like science fiction.

00:29:41.505 --> 00:29:42.922
Science fiction.

00:29:46.383 --> 00:29:47.759
You're right.

00:29:48.552 --> 00:29:49.929
It's crazy.

00:29:51.013 --> 00:29:53.598
In fact, it's even
worse than that: nuts!

00:29:55.683 --> 00:29:57.143
Want to hear something nutty?

00:29:57.309 --> 00:29:59.853
Two guys wanted to build
a thing called an airplane.

00:30:00.061 --> 00:30:03.106
People go in it and fly like
birds. Ridiculous, right?

00:30:03.357 --> 00:30:05.108
What about breaking
the sound barrier...

00:30:05.358 --> 00:30:06.973
...or rockets to the moon, or

00:30:06.974 --> 00:30:09.029
atomic energy or
a mission to Mars?

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.905
Science fiction, right?

00:30:12.699 --> 00:30:14.827
All I'm asking
is for you to just

00:30:14.828 --> 00:30:16.827
have the tiniest bit of vision.

00:30:17.202 --> 00:30:20.539
To step back and look
at the big picture.

00:30:20.915 --> 00:30:23.539
Take a chance on
something which could

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.962
end up the most
impactful moment...

00:30:26.212 --> 00:30:28.505
...for humanity,
for the history...

00:30:29.131 --> 00:30:30.423
...of history.

00:30:34.217 --> 00:30:35.220
I'm sorry.

00:30:36.304 --> 00:30:37.930
I just spent 13 months...

00:30:38.555 --> 00:30:41.391
...coming into rooms and
talking to people like you.

00:30:42.267 --> 00:30:43.644
You're my last chance.

00:30:45.103 --> 00:30:46.686
Sorry I wasted your time.

00:30:46.897 --> 00:30:47.479
Doctor.

00:30:48.358 --> 00:30:49.441
Yes, sir.

00:31:01.786 --> 00:31:03.036
You have your money.

00:31:06.082 --> 00:31:07.251
Thank you.

00:31:09.335 --> 00:31:10.336
Thank you.

00:31:58.336 --> 00:32:01.339
Perfect cast! Come on, fishy!

00:32:01.589 --> 00:32:03.090
Frank, look at the size...

00:32:03.302 --> 00:32:05.302
...of that
son-of-a-bitch!

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:19.689
Welcome back, Dr. C.

00:32:19.942 --> 00:32:21.443
How'd it go?

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.695
How was the trip?

00:32:23.944 --> 00:32:25.362
I've had better.

00:32:25.988 --> 00:32:29.034
Drumlin! Is this a
personal vendetta now?

00:32:29.282 --> 00:32:33.120
There's been enormous pressure
from other scientists as well.

00:32:33.328 --> 00:32:36.454
It doesn't matter. Hadden's
funding us for 2 more years.

00:32:36.666 --> 00:32:38.705
The government
doesn't want their

00:32:38.706 --> 00:32:41.168
telescopes used by
the high priestess...

00:32:41.376 --> 00:32:43.377
...of the desert anymore.

00:32:44.711 --> 00:32:45.672
What?

00:32:45.839 --> 00:32:49.176
Staring at TV static for hours,
listening to washing machines.

00:32:49.425 --> 00:32:51.427
These stories get out!

00:32:51.635 --> 00:32:53.306
I was seeking
patterns in the chaos!

00:32:53.473 --> 00:32:55.557
It doesn't matter,
we're a joke to them.

00:32:55.767 --> 00:32:57.142
They want us out!

00:32:58.934 --> 00:33:01.814
We've got 3 months till
the paperwork goes through.

00:33:05.649 --> 00:33:07.818
I'll start looking
for other funding.

00:33:08.359 --> 00:33:12.113
Could you face reality?
Just this once? We lost.

00:33:12.863 --> 00:33:14.157
It's over.

00:33:20.829 --> 00:33:21.996
Fine.

00:33:22.665 --> 00:33:24.249
I'm not stopping.

00:33:24.832 --> 00:33:27.921
If I have to, I'll go it
alone. I've done it before.

00:34:17.632 --> 00:34:21.343
My guest tonight is author
and theologian Palmer Joss.

00:34:21.677 --> 00:34:24.095
He's become a
spiritual counselor, and

00:34:24.096 --> 00:34:26.390
a recent fixture
at the White House.

00:34:26.682 --> 00:34:29.643
"God's Diplomat," according
to The New York Times.

00:34:29.851 --> 00:34:31.869
His latest book,
"Losing Faith,"

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:33.523
is currently number one...

00:34:33.732 --> 00:34:36.026
...on that publication's
bestseller list.

00:34:36.232 --> 00:34:39.192
Thanks for being here.
You've had quite a ride...

00:34:39.402 --> 00:34:40.903
...the last few years.

00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:42.779
Yeah, I sure have, Larry.

00:34:43.571 --> 00:34:45.781
Fish, I was thinking.

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:50.538
Who would make the best
astronomers? Think about it.

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:55.666
Who has the perfect synthesis
of career and lifestyle?

00:34:56.876 --> 00:34:57.835
I give.

00:34:58.042 --> 00:34:59.587
Vampires!

00:34:59.921 --> 00:35:02.464
Are you anti-technology
and anti-science?

00:35:02.715 --> 00:35:04.382
No, not at all.

00:35:04.717 --> 00:35:07.511
The question that
I'm asking is this:

00:35:08.262 --> 00:35:09.721
Are we happier...

00:35:10.388 --> 00:35:12.167
...as a human
race? Is the world

00:35:12.168 --> 00:35:13.890
fundamentally a better place...

00:35:14.099 --> 00:35:16.102
...because of science
and technology?

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:19.231
We shop at home,
we surf the Web...

00:35:19.397 --> 00:35:22.066
...but at the same
time we feel emptier...

00:35:22.399 --> 00:35:24.622
...and more cut
off from each other

00:35:24.623 --> 00:35:27.153
than at any other
time in human history.

00:35:27.403 --> 00:35:29.947
We're becoming a
synthesized society...

00:35:30.239 --> 00:35:32.409
...in a hurry to get to the...

00:35:47.128 --> 00:35:48.800
We're looking for the meaning.

00:35:49.131 --> 00:35:50.424
What is the meaning?

00:35:50.592 --> 00:35:53.344
We have mindless jobs,
take frantic vacations.

00:35:53.762 --> 00:35:56.721
Deficit finance trips to
the mall to buy things...

00:35:56.975 --> 00:36:00.518
...that we think will fill
these holes in our lives.

00:36:00.977 --> 00:36:03.395
Any wonder we've lost
our sense of direction?

00:36:44.267 --> 00:36:45.934
Holy shit!

00:37:04.244 --> 00:37:05.203
Right ascension...

00:37:05.411 --> 00:37:09.288
...18 hours, 36
minutes, 56.2 seconds!

00:37:10.414 --> 00:37:12.080
Declination...

00:37:12.376 --> 00:37:15.336
...+ 36 degrees, 46 minutes...

00:37:15.712 --> 00:37:17.922
...56.2 seconds!

00:37:20.423 --> 00:37:21.885
Confirm!

00:37:22.092 --> 00:37:25.178
Right ascension, 18
hours, 36 minutes...

00:37:25.346 --> 00:37:27.513
...56.2 seconds!

00:37:28.181 --> 00:37:31.016
Is anybody awake in there?
I'm moving the array!

00:37:31.227 --> 00:37:33.186
- Confirm!

00:37:33.395 --> 00:37:34.896
Boss has a bogey!

00:37:35.104 --> 00:37:37.316
Right ascension, 18 hours...

00:37:41.778 --> 00:37:42.984
We're on it!

00:37:43.194 --> 00:37:44.153
36 hours...

00:37:44.612 --> 00:37:46.573
...47 minutes and 1 second!

00:37:47.033 --> 00:37:48.366
Strong possible...

00:37:48.575 --> 00:37:51.078
...pulse chain
on sub-array four!

00:37:51.284 --> 00:37:53.786
I'm moving the rest.
Confirm coordinates!

00:37:54.749 --> 00:37:56.625
Check the status of the array.

00:37:56.916 --> 00:37:58.291
She's doing all the dishes.

00:37:58.709 --> 00:37:59.585
Systems nominal.

00:38:05.465 --> 00:38:06.591
Hello.

00:38:07.843 --> 00:38:08.885
Full systems check!

00:38:09.761 --> 00:38:12.430
Coordinates confirmed.
Willie's checking the system.

00:38:12.763 --> 00:38:15.598
Stay on top of the
systems diagnostics!

00:38:15.891 --> 00:38:17.600
Check reference point offsets.

00:38:17.809 --> 00:38:21.813
And I want you off-axis on
27 the second we get there!

00:38:21.981 --> 00:38:24.483
And tell Willie to
break out the big boy!

00:38:26.066 --> 00:38:27.109
Copy that.

00:38:28.612 --> 00:38:29.905
Yeah! Go, Ellie!

00:38:30.113 --> 00:38:33.282
I hear it on the headphones.
We got to be sure about this.

00:38:33.616 --> 00:38:35.786
Give me another array status.

00:38:37.619 --> 00:38:41.124
Her four are online,
the rest are tracking in.

00:38:43.624 --> 00:38:45.962
But there's a bad drive on 16.

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:48.589
The four are online,
the rest are tracking in.

00:38:48.881 --> 00:38:51.674
There's a bad drive
on 16. Copy that?

00:38:53.134 --> 00:38:55.135
What shall I do about
the source queue?

00:38:55.343 --> 00:38:57.305
Forget it and hold the queue.

00:38:57.638 --> 00:38:59.778
Get ready to set
the target frequency

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:01.809
to manual the
second we're aligned.

00:39:02.018 --> 00:39:03.858
Do you copy? I want you to go

00:39:03.859 --> 00:39:06.395
off-axis on 27 the
second we're there!

00:39:06.645 --> 00:39:09.275
And leave the LO
frequency where it is!

00:39:09.648 --> 00:39:12.775
Don't let it get away! If
you lose it, scan the band!

00:39:12.986 --> 00:39:15.613
Run every frequency
you can think of.

00:39:20.994 --> 00:39:22.286
How you doing?

00:39:26.874 --> 00:39:28.000
Talk to me, guys.

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:31.879
Partially polarized moving
pulses, amplitude modulated.

00:39:32.087 --> 00:39:35.756
We're locked. Systems are
fine. What's the frequency?

00:39:36.006 --> 00:39:36.965
4.46...

00:39:37.217 --> 00:39:38.717
...23 gigahertz.

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:42.135
Hydrogen times pi.

00:39:42.515 --> 00:39:43.640
Told you!

00:39:43.931 --> 00:39:45.598
Strong sucker too!

00:39:46.682 --> 00:39:48.225
I got it! I'm patched in!

00:39:48.936 --> 00:39:49.977
Let me hear.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:57.068
Listen to that.

00:39:59.364 --> 00:40:01.321
Make me a liar, Fish.

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.492
It could be AWACS out
of Kirkland jamming us.

00:40:04.742 --> 00:40:05.908
But I doubt it.

00:40:06.158 --> 00:40:08.329
See if F.U.D.D.'s
reading it too.

00:40:10.412 --> 00:40:12.499
Patch it back and
give me the off-axis.

00:40:13.124 --> 00:40:14.792
- We recording?
- Never stopped.

00:40:16.877 --> 00:40:18.170
Thank you, Elmer!

00:40:18.379 --> 00:40:20.172
AWACS status is negative.

00:40:20.381 --> 00:40:21.382
White Sands?

00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:23.216
On this frequency? No.

00:40:23.674 --> 00:40:25.010
I'll punch up the darks.

00:40:28.221 --> 00:40:29.388
How's spying tonight?

00:40:30.473 --> 00:40:31.807
Come on!

00:40:34.185 --> 00:40:36.562
NORAD's not tracking any
snoops in this vector.

00:40:37.021 --> 00:40:38.397
Shuttle's in sleep mode.

00:40:38.731 --> 00:40:40.902
Okay, point source confirmed.

00:40:41.194 --> 00:40:42.777
Whatever it is, it ain't local.

00:40:43.026 --> 00:40:43.819
Position?

00:40:44.028 --> 00:40:46.487
I checked interferometry.
Somewhere in Lyra.

00:40:46.696 --> 00:40:48.363
- Vega?
- Can't be!

00:40:48.574 --> 00:40:50.577
It's only 26 light years away.

00:40:50.867 --> 00:40:52.785
- Peak intensity?
- Coming up!

00:40:54.037 --> 00:40:54.746
Vega.

00:40:55.497 --> 00:40:57.455
Vega. I scanned
it a bunch of times

00:40:57.456 --> 00:40:59.416
at Arecibo. It was
always negative.

00:40:59.625 --> 00:41:00.626
Got it!

00:41:00.751 --> 00:41:02.586
Reading over 100 janskys.

00:41:03.334 --> 00:41:05.836
Jesus! I can pick
it up on my...

00:41:08.757 --> 00:41:09.758
No!

00:41:43.039 --> 00:41:44.040
Come on!

00:41:46.291 --> 00:41:47.501
It's restarting.

00:41:48.921 --> 00:41:50.630
Wait a minute.
Those are numbers.

00:41:50.839 --> 00:41:52.590
That was 3, before it was 2.

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:56.593
Base 10 numbers. Count
and see how far we get.

00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.346
One.

00:42:05.018 --> 00:42:06.020
Seven.

00:42:08.814 --> 00:42:10.357
Those are primes.

00:42:10.565 --> 00:42:13.776
2, 3, 5, 7 are
all prime numbers.

00:42:14.236 --> 00:42:16.111
No way that's a
natural phenomenon!

00:42:16.321 --> 00:42:19.157
Let's just calm down and
pull up the star file on Vega.

00:42:20.657 --> 00:42:23.952
It doesn't make any sense.
The system is too young.

00:42:24.161 --> 00:42:25.787
It can't have a
planetary system...

00:42:25.995 --> 00:42:29.247
...let alone life or a
technological civilization.

00:42:29.542 --> 00:42:31.961
Maybe they're not from
there, they're visiting.

00:42:32.167 --> 00:42:35.504
Spacecraft? This system's full
of debris. It'd get clobbered.

00:42:35.921 --> 00:42:39.967
Not if they used their laser
blasters and photon torpedoes.

00:42:40.301 --> 00:42:43.178
- That's not funny.
- How else can we explain it!

00:42:43.677 --> 00:42:46.641
He's right. If we go public
with this and we're wrong...

00:42:46.848 --> 00:42:49.142
...it's over. We're cooked.

00:42:51.977 --> 00:42:53.313
I wish Kent was here.

00:42:53.521 --> 00:42:56.985
Whatever it is, let's do
something. Vega will set.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.698
Position confirmed. We've got
4.4623 gigahertz, confirmed.

00:43:04.905 --> 00:43:07.701
We've got 112 janskys.

00:43:08.033 --> 00:43:10.244
Do you have a
source location yet?

00:43:12.789 --> 00:43:15.167
We put it right
smack in the middle.

00:43:15.875 --> 00:43:17.124
Vega.

00:43:19.333 --> 00:43:22.214
Thanks. Keep tracking
and we'll get back to you.

00:43:22.505 --> 00:43:23.673
Right-o.

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.810
101. The pulse sequenced...

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:40.355
...through every prime
number between 2 and 101.

00:43:42.316 --> 00:43:44.026
Who do we call now?

00:43:47.236 --> 00:43:48.237
Everybody.

00:43:55.995 --> 00:43:59.540
The rumors are flying, the
implications extraordinary.

00:43:59.706 --> 00:44:01.627
Detection of an unidentified...

00:44:01.793 --> 00:44:03.806
...radio source from space can

00:44:03.807 --> 00:44:06.087
neither be
confirmed nor denied.

00:44:06.337 --> 00:44:08.213
But the military arriving...

00:44:08.422 --> 00:44:12.010
Sources close to the VLA report
they have been contacted...

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.222
...by some form of
intelligent being...

00:44:14.386 --> 00:44:16.735
...living outside
our solar system.

00:44:16.736 --> 00:44:18.893
Again, there is
no confirmation.

00:44:22.102 --> 00:44:24.188
I want all of these
people out of here.

00:44:25.021 --> 00:44:26.312
Where's the girl?

00:44:30.945 --> 00:44:32.276
22 stations worldwide...

00:44:32.529 --> 00:44:33.904
...now confirm the signal.

00:44:34.072 --> 00:44:35.740
Vega's now below our horizon.

00:44:35.908 --> 00:44:38.326
You're hearing the
signal from the Russian...

00:44:38.534 --> 00:44:40.118
Get decryption people here.

00:44:40.368 --> 00:44:42.411
Lunacharsky's
visiting at Cal Tech.

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:43.956
Explain this to me.

00:44:44.206 --> 00:44:46.064
If the source of
the signal is so

00:44:46.065 --> 00:44:48.252
sophisticated... why
the remedial math?

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:49.794
Why not just speak English?

00:44:50.043 --> 00:44:53.464
Maybe because 70% of the
planet speaks other languages.

00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:56.466
Mathematics is the only
truly universal language.

00:44:57.135 --> 00:44:59.635
It's no coincidence that
they're using primes.

00:44:59.888 --> 00:45:00.805
I don't get it.

00:45:01.139 --> 00:45:02.349
Prime numbers.

00:45:02.514 --> 00:45:06.060
Integers only divisible
by themselves and 1.

00:45:08.979 --> 00:45:11.814
We think this may be a
beacon, an announcement...

00:45:12.106 --> 00:45:13.857
...to get our attention.

00:45:14.064 --> 00:45:17.779
If it's attention you want,
you got that. One thing: Vega.

00:45:17.988 --> 00:45:21.447
People have looked at Vega
for years, with no results.

00:45:21.657 --> 00:45:24.616
Yesterday they start
broadcasting primes. Why?

00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:26.204
It's hardly yesterday.

00:45:26.412 --> 00:45:28.955
The signal's been
transmitting for 26 years.

00:45:30.331 --> 00:45:31.747
Excuse me, who are you?

00:45:31.999 --> 00:45:34.462
Michael Kitz, National
Security Advisor.

00:45:34.628 --> 00:45:35.961
Your reputation...

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:39.548
First, ask the gentlemen
with the guns to wait outside.

00:45:40.257 --> 00:45:42.343
This is a civilian facility.

00:45:48.848 --> 00:45:50.309
With all due respect...

00:45:50.474 --> 00:45:51.350
Excuse me.

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:55.104
Hi! I'm so glad you're back!

00:45:55.687 --> 00:45:56.855
Come hear this.

00:45:57.607 --> 00:45:58.899
Is this great?

00:45:59.108 --> 00:46:01.486
- Who are all these people?
- I have no idea.

00:46:01.693 --> 00:46:04.820
Sit down. We need help
with the spectrum analysis.

00:46:04.987 --> 00:46:06.658
- I'll get on it.
- Headsets.

00:46:06.866 --> 00:46:08.993
I'll just come
right to the point.

00:46:09.284 --> 00:46:11.285
Announcing this all
over the world may

00:46:11.286 --> 00:46:13.287
well be a breach of
national security.

00:46:13.453 --> 00:46:15.166
It's not a
person-to-person call.

00:46:15.374 --> 00:46:17.412
You think a
civilization sending this

00:46:17.413 --> 00:46:19.502
message intends it
just for Americans?

00:46:19.667 --> 00:46:21.544
You might have consulted us.

00:46:21.877 --> 00:46:23.911
- The contents could
be very sensitive.

00:46:23.912 --> 00:46:25.842
- You want to
classify prime numbers?

00:46:26.509 --> 00:46:28.202
Due to earth's
rotation, we're in

00:46:28.203 --> 00:46:29.844
line with Vega
only hours a day.

00:46:30.053 --> 00:46:32.161
The only way to
monitor the signal

00:46:32.162 --> 00:46:34.389
is to cooperate
with other stations.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.397
If Dr. Arroway hadn't acted

00:46:36.398 --> 00:46:38.936
quickly, we'd have
lost key elements.

00:46:39.143 --> 00:46:40.687
Fine, they've got the primes.

00:46:40.896 --> 00:46:43.689
But if a more significant
transmission is to come...

00:46:43.898 --> 00:46:45.857
We need help to
receive and decode.

00:46:46.068 --> 00:46:48.738
You understand that
my job is to protect...

00:46:49.988 --> 00:46:51.907
- Listen.
- I hear it.

00:46:52.241 --> 00:46:53.199
Hear what?

00:46:53.406 --> 00:46:54.366
Harmonic.

00:46:54.575 --> 00:46:58.412
Bingo! I had Willie ask Rattan
to retune to 8.9247 gigahertz.

00:46:58.578 --> 00:47:00.205
There's a lot more here.

00:47:00.413 --> 00:47:03.042
- Get on the negative sideband.
- I'm already on it.

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:04.376
What is it?

00:47:04.583 --> 00:47:06.045
Another signal!

00:47:06.254 --> 00:47:09.090
A second signal at double
the frequency. Looks like...

00:47:09.923 --> 00:47:11.299
Get a TV monitor!

00:47:12.006 --> 00:47:13.884
Patch it into the
image processor.

00:47:14.093 --> 00:47:15.385
Want the new data?

00:47:15.593 --> 00:47:17.388
Yeah, the new one
we just recorded.

00:47:17.596 --> 00:47:19.557
David, explain
this to me, please.

00:47:19.765 --> 00:47:22.560
There's another signal.
Looks like a TV transmission.

00:47:22.768 --> 00:47:23.726
We're hot.

00:47:23.935 --> 00:47:26.687
Go get the blinds.
There is a lot of glare.

00:47:27.771 --> 00:47:29.188
You're patched in.

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.860
It's definitely an image.
Let's try and stabilize it.

00:47:37.613 --> 00:47:39.325
What do you make of that?

00:47:39.534 --> 00:47:42.536
It's two different interlaced
frames. I'm framing one.

00:47:45.872 --> 00:47:48.625
- It's just noise.
- Trying frame two.

00:47:49.835 --> 00:47:53.172
I've got an offset
carrier. I think it's audio.

00:47:53.379 --> 00:47:54.629
Plug it in!

00:47:58.925 --> 00:48:00.217
Center that segment.

00:48:00.426 --> 00:48:01.553
Centering.

00:48:05.807 --> 00:48:07.100
Can you clean it up?

00:48:07.308 --> 00:48:08.767
I'm working on it.

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.156
What the hell...?

00:48:23.907 --> 00:48:25.159
Try zooming out.

00:48:29.162 --> 00:48:30.123
Freeze!

00:48:30.331 --> 00:48:31.624
Reverse values.

00:48:33.249 --> 00:48:35.001
Try zooming out again.

00:48:39.003 --> 00:48:41.172
Rotate 90 degrees
counterclock...

00:48:42.756 --> 00:48:44.300
My God!

00:48:51.013 --> 00:48:52.475
What's going on?

00:48:53.016 --> 00:48:55.436
You're not going
to believe this.

00:49:08.906 --> 00:49:10.618
Does anybody speak German?

00:49:12.035 --> 00:49:14.453
"I declare the
Games in Berlin...

00:49:15.538 --> 00:49:17.247
...at the celebration...

00:49:17.457 --> 00:49:20.334
...of the first Olympics
of the New Era...

00:49:20.584 --> 00:49:21.876
...as opened. "

00:49:32.637 --> 00:49:34.054
Get me the White House.

00:49:34.887 --> 00:49:37.308
20 million people died
defeating the bastard...

00:49:37.516 --> 00:49:40.310
...and he's our first
ambassador to outer space?

00:49:40.518 --> 00:49:42.190
The broadcast of
the '36 Olympics

00:49:42.191 --> 00:49:43.815
was the first TV
transmission...

00:49:44.065 --> 00:49:45.523
...that went into space.

00:49:45.773 --> 00:49:49.069
Sending it back is a way of
saying, "Hello, we heard you. "

00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:51.611
Or, "Sieg Heil, you're
our kind of people. "

00:49:51.862 --> 00:49:54.324
Hitler's politics have
nothing to do with this.

00:49:54.534 --> 00:49:58.161
It's unlikely they understood
it. People must understand...

00:49:58.369 --> 00:50:00.746
The people are in very
good hands, Doctor.

00:50:00.913 --> 00:50:02.705
We'll take it from here.

00:50:03.747 --> 00:50:05.710
Smile, folks. We're on.

00:50:06.001 --> 00:50:08.293
A message of unknown
origin from deep space...

00:50:08.543 --> 00:50:10.042
...was received by American

00:50:10.043 --> 00:50:12.090
scientists. Now
to the White House.

00:50:12.631 --> 00:50:15.842
We're told the President will
have only a few remarks...

00:50:16.092 --> 00:50:17.554
...about today's
extraordinary events...

00:50:17.802 --> 00:50:21.139
...and that he won't be taking
any questions from the press.

00:50:26.145 --> 00:50:27.438
Good afternoon.

00:50:30.315 --> 00:50:32.441
I'm glad to be joined by my...

00:50:32.649 --> 00:50:34.569
...Science and
Technology Advisor.

00:50:36.322 --> 00:50:39.157
This is the product of
years of exploration...

00:50:39.365 --> 00:50:42.659
...by some of the world's
most distinguished scientists.

00:50:42.868 --> 00:50:44.453
Like all discoveries...

00:50:44.703 --> 00:50:46.996
...this one will
continue to be reviewed...

00:50:47.204 --> 00:50:48.247
...examined...

00:50:48.498 --> 00:50:49.956
...and scrutinized.

00:50:50.164 --> 00:50:53.169
It must be confirmed
by other scientists.

00:50:53.502 --> 00:50:54.628
But clearly...

00:50:55.171 --> 00:50:58.631
...the fact that this is being
explored is a vindication...

00:50:59.508 --> 00:51:01.428
Fish, what is the
story over here? I

00:51:01.429 --> 00:51:03.345
thought Ellie was
supposed to be on.

00:51:03.512 --> 00:51:04.971
I don't know.

00:51:05.636 --> 00:51:07.012
Guys?

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:12.062
Those interlaced frames
we thought were noise?

00:51:13.061 --> 00:51:15.691
This has structure.
I'm hearing structure.

00:51:17.068 --> 00:51:19.318
If this discovery
is confirmed...

00:51:19.527 --> 00:51:21.052
...it will be one of the most

00:51:21.053 --> 00:51:23.155
stunning insights
into our universe...

00:51:23.363 --> 00:51:25.406
...that science
has ever uncovered.

00:51:25.949 --> 00:51:28.243
Its implications are
as far-reaching...

00:51:28.535 --> 00:51:31.078
...and awe-inspiring
as can be imagined.

00:51:31.328 --> 00:51:34.750
Even as it promises answers to
some of our oldest questions...

00:51:34.999 --> 00:51:36.583
...it poses still others...

00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:38.417
...even more fundamental.

00:51:38.627 --> 00:51:40.544
We will continue
to listen closely...

00:51:40.713 --> 00:51:42.256
...to what it has to say...

00:51:42.463 --> 00:51:44.550
...as we continue the
search for answers...

00:51:44.757 --> 00:51:46.051
...and for knowledge...

00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:48.552
...that is as old
as humanity itself...

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.681
...but essential to
our people's future.

00:51:52.099 --> 00:51:52.808
Thank you.

00:51:53.057 --> 00:51:55.934
Is there a renewed
assessment of security threat?

00:51:56.184 --> 00:51:59.187
I'll answer your questions
after a few corrections.

00:51:59.397 --> 00:52:01.149
The message was
received Friday...

00:52:01.314 --> 00:52:03.401
...at 6:31 a. m.
Mountain Standard Time.

00:52:03.651 --> 00:52:05.192
It was largely mathematical...

00:52:05.401 --> 00:52:08.114
...and in spite of
reports to the contrary...

00:52:08.404 --> 00:52:10.948
...appears to be
completely benign in nature.

00:52:11.115 --> 00:52:15.035
Let me say that again. The
message is completely benign.

00:52:15.244 --> 00:52:18.456
The President has contacted
the world's heads of state...

00:52:18.664 --> 00:52:21.416
...and every security
measure is being taken.

00:52:21.666 --> 00:52:24.712
To better explain the events
of the last 48 hours...

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:27.157
...is the leader of
the scientific team

00:52:27.158 --> 00:52:29.339
that made this
remarkable discovery...

00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:31.386
...Dr. David Drumlin, special

00:52:31.386 --> 00:52:33.552
Science Advisor
to the President.

00:52:41.604 --> 00:52:43.020
Thank you, Rachel.

00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:44.396
Hello.

00:52:46.314 --> 00:52:48.816
In 1936 a very faint
television signal...

00:52:49.025 --> 00:52:51.247
...transmitted the
opening ceremonies

00:52:51.248 --> 00:52:53.236
of the Olympic
Games as a show...

00:52:53.488 --> 00:52:55.949
...of German
superior technology.

00:52:56.992 --> 00:52:58.776
That signal left Earth at the

00:52:58.777 --> 00:53:01.119
speed of light and
26 years later...

00:53:01.369 --> 00:53:04.998
...arrived in the vicinity
of the star we call Vega.

00:53:06.208 --> 00:53:10.043
That signal has been sent
back to us hugely amplified...

00:53:10.377 --> 00:53:13.340
...an unmistakable
sign of intelligence.

00:53:13.548 --> 00:53:14.548
Kent, go ahead.

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.058
The Adolf transmission
used 25 frames

00:53:17.059 --> 00:53:19.135
per second but
we're receiving 50.

00:53:19.344 --> 00:53:23.225
So we put the other 25
through search algorithms.

00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:26.017
We found a series of markers
on the top of each frame.

00:53:26.227 --> 00:53:27.976
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, go ahead!

00:53:28.186 --> 00:53:29.314
Send it, Willie.

00:53:29.563 --> 00:53:31.064
Here it comes.

00:53:34.358 --> 00:53:35.691
It's digital...

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:37.821
...massive amounts
of data which

00:53:37.822 --> 00:53:40.030
extend right to the
higher harmonics.

00:53:40.739 --> 00:53:42.117
Jackpot!

00:53:43.406 --> 00:53:45.367
All right, as you'll see...

00:53:45.575 --> 00:53:48.955
...interlaced with the frames
of the original Hitler image...

00:53:49.205 --> 00:53:52.041
...we found these sections.

00:53:52.249 --> 00:53:55.670
We thought they were noise,
but they're actually data...

00:53:55.837 --> 00:53:57.170
...huge amounts of it.

00:53:57.379 --> 00:53:59.396
When we combine this with the

00:53:59.397 --> 00:54:01.757
data from the
original signal...

00:54:01.925 --> 00:54:05.221
...we get these
encrypted pages of text.

00:54:05.429 --> 00:54:09.598
No two are alike and we've
uncovered over 10,000 already.

00:54:09.766 --> 00:54:11.934
What does it mean, Doctor?

00:54:12.351 --> 00:54:15.186
We have no idea. It
could be anything.

00:54:15.353 --> 00:54:17.522
Volume 1 of an
Encyclopedia Galactica.

00:54:17.729 --> 00:54:20.358
Instructions for us on their
colonization procedures.

00:54:20.569 --> 00:54:22.903
Moses with a few
billion new commandments.

00:54:23.069 --> 00:54:25.236
How long will it
take to decode it?

00:54:25.447 --> 00:54:28.782
It could take forever.
We really need a primer...

00:54:28.908 --> 00:54:32.035
We need to get the best
decryption people we have.

00:54:32.746 --> 00:54:36.833
I intend to use the
VLA as my command post.

00:54:36.958 --> 00:54:40.545
In the meantime, my office has
made out a preliminary budget.

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:42.044
Wait a minute.

00:54:42.254 --> 00:54:44.549
This is a
privately-funded operation.

00:54:44.758 --> 00:54:47.049
We lease dish time
from the government...

00:54:47.258 --> 00:54:49.887
This is a clear-cut
case of eminent domain.

00:54:50.094 --> 00:54:51.832
I'm recommending
to the President

00:54:51.833 --> 00:54:53.263
we militarize this project.

00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:55.975
What?! This is my project!

00:54:56.142 --> 00:54:59.476
Nobody knows more about this
than I do. David, tell them...

00:54:59.643 --> 00:55:02.689
Excuse me! Could
we calm down here?

00:55:02.938 --> 00:55:05.441
I'm going to recommend
that Dr. Drumlin

00:55:05.442 --> 00:55:07.569
coordinate the
decryption effort.

00:55:07.777 --> 00:55:09.241
But in light of Dr. Arroway's

00:55:09.242 --> 00:55:11.114
long experience
in these matters...

00:55:11.323 --> 00:55:15.493
...for the time being, she will
direct operations at the VLA...

00:55:15.659 --> 00:55:18.116
...understanding that
future discoveries

00:55:18.117 --> 00:55:20.332
will be kept in
strict confidence...

00:55:20.498 --> 00:55:22.750
...until such time
as the President...

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.836
...can decide the most suitable
course of action. Understood?

00:55:27.004 --> 00:55:28.005
Yes.

00:55:28.254 --> 00:55:30.507
This is CNN Breaking News.

00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:34.050
The President called
the message from Vega...

00:55:34.258 --> 00:55:36.385
..."a stunning insight
into our universe... "

00:55:36.594 --> 00:55:39.056
Attendance at
religious services has

00:55:39.057 --> 00:55:41.515
risen a dramatic
39% in recent days.

00:55:41.682 --> 00:55:45.520
...as police clashed
with neo-Nazi protesters.

00:55:45.769 --> 00:55:47.896
So, there's life
on other planets.

00:55:48.106 --> 00:55:51.691
Boy, this will really change
the Miss Universe contest.

00:55:52.361 --> 00:55:54.192
Health officials worldwide are

00:55:54.193 --> 00:55:56.696
concerned that the
message from Vega...

00:55:56.864 --> 00:55:59.493
...might trigger a
rash of mass suicides...

00:55:59.702 --> 00:56:02.327
...not unlike recent cult
deaths near San Diego...

00:56:02.537 --> 00:56:04.495
Even a scientist must admit...

00:56:04.704 --> 00:56:06.914
...there are some
pretty serious

00:56:06.915 --> 00:56:09.127
religious overtones
to all this.

00:56:09.378 --> 00:56:11.585
Here's someone
whose organization...

00:56:11.794 --> 00:56:14.256
...is accused of conducting
its own inquisition:

00:56:14.463 --> 00:56:17.258
Richard Rank, head of the
Conservative Coalition.

00:56:17.466 --> 00:56:18.509
Thank you.

00:56:18.717 --> 00:56:20.975
This is yet another
example of science

00:56:20.976 --> 00:56:22.886
intruding into
matters of faith.

00:56:23.971 --> 00:56:27.307
This means they have been
reacting to TV signals...

00:56:27.474 --> 00:56:30.351
...from the 1930's.
They're just getting them.

00:56:30.561 --> 00:56:32.114
Imagine how disappointed

00:56:32.115 --> 00:56:34.315
they'll be if
they're Cubs fans.

00:56:34.566 --> 00:56:37.608
We now go to Jeremy
Roth, who is reporting...

00:56:37.818 --> 00:56:41.282
...from the Very Large Array
near Socorro, New Mexico.

00:56:41.489 --> 00:56:42.990
Like a bolt from
the blue it came.

00:56:43.239 --> 00:56:45.199
"The Message from
Vega" has caused...

00:56:45.408 --> 00:56:47.827
...thousands of believers
and non-believers...

00:56:47.994 --> 00:56:49.927
...to descend upon
the VLA facility

00:56:49.928 --> 00:56:51.748
here in the desert
of New Mexico.

00:56:51.915 --> 00:56:54.542
Many have come to
protest, many to pray...

00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:56.995
...but most have
come to participate

00:56:56.996 --> 00:56:59.421
in what's become the
best show in town.

00:57:05.049 --> 00:57:07.554
Well, I saw the thing
coming out of the sky

00:57:07.888 --> 00:57:11.014
It had one long
horn and one big eye

00:57:11.306 --> 00:57:13.934
I commenced to
shaking and said Oo-ee

00:57:14.391 --> 00:57:17.353
Looks like a Purple
People Eater to me

00:58:08.483 --> 00:58:10.027
Hail to Vega Hail to Vega

00:58:15.992 --> 00:58:17.785
But they have failed!

00:58:18.284 --> 00:58:21.078
It's the same people
who, again and again...

00:58:21.285 --> 00:58:23.414
...have brought us to
the brink of destruction!

00:58:23.664 --> 00:58:27.333
Who've polluted our air,
who've poisoned our water!

00:58:28.836 --> 00:58:30.922
Now these scientists...

00:58:31.839 --> 00:58:33.800
...have had their chance.

00:58:34.007 --> 00:58:37.094
Are these the kind of people...

00:58:37.469 --> 00:58:41.306
...that you want talking
to your God for you?

00:58:45.226 --> 00:58:47.186
Efforts continue
around the clock.

00:58:47.354 --> 00:58:49.267
But for now,
almost 2 full weeks

00:58:49.268 --> 00:58:51.065
after the message's arrival...

00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:54.483
...scientists here at the
VLA still have no answers...

00:58:54.691 --> 00:58:56.447
...only more questions.

00:58:56.654 --> 00:58:59.990
Jeremy Roth, CNN,
Socorro, New Mexico.

00:59:00.324 --> 00:59:03.703
More on the quest for the
message's meaning, after this.

00:59:06.537 --> 00:59:08.330
They have to line up somehow.

00:59:08.581 --> 00:59:10.499
This one doesn't fit, either.

00:59:10.707 --> 00:59:13.377
We've tried over a
million permutations.

00:59:13.585 --> 00:59:16.881
Always, I can only get
three corners to fit.

00:59:17.882 --> 00:59:20.053
I don't understand
their significance.

01:00:03.507 --> 01:00:04.632
Somebody broke in...

01:00:11.098 --> 01:00:12.139
Hello?

01:00:13.099 --> 01:00:16.310
Whoever you are, you
broke into the database...

01:00:19.271 --> 01:00:20.606
What? Now?

01:00:23.442 --> 01:00:24.651
Where?

01:00:36.538 --> 01:00:38.538
I'll be there.

01:01:06.772 --> 01:01:08.189
You should feel fortunate.

01:01:08.858 --> 01:01:10.358
He hardly lands for anyone.

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:43.891
Dr. Arroway.

01:01:47.809 --> 01:01:49.146
I presume?

01:01:50.398 --> 01:01:51.606
Mr. Hadden.

01:01:52.856 --> 01:01:56.107
I've had my eye on you
a long time, Doctor.

01:01:56.901 --> 01:02:00.447
I consider you one of my most
valuable long-term investments.

01:02:02.281 --> 01:02:04.701
And when it comes
to my investments...

01:02:06.451 --> 01:02:09.121
...I always do my homework.

01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:15.587
Eleanor Ann Arroway...

01:02:15.754 --> 01:02:18.296
...born 25th August, 1964...

01:02:18.506 --> 01:02:20.091
...De Pere, Wisconsin.

01:02:20.299 --> 01:02:22.082
Mother, Joanna, died from

01:02:22.083 --> 01:02:24.512
complications
during childbirth.

01:02:25.222 --> 01:02:27.931
Early testing indicated
high predisposition...

01:02:28.138 --> 01:02:31.140
...towards science
and mathematics.

01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:33.017
Father, Theodore...

01:02:33.228 --> 01:02:35.090
...advised to
provide enrichment

01:02:35.091 --> 01:02:36.729
activities in these areas...

01:02:36.939 --> 01:02:39.690
...did so conscientiously
until his death...

01:02:39.899 --> 01:02:43.736
...from myocardial
infarction, November 10, 1974.

01:02:45.070 --> 01:02:48.489
You graduated from
high school in 1979...

01:02:48.742 --> 01:02:50.702
...almost two full years early.

01:02:52.078 --> 01:02:54.080
Awarded full
scholarship, M.I.T...

01:02:54.246 --> 01:02:56.457
...graduated magna cum laude.

01:02:57.418 --> 01:02:59.127
Doctoral work, Cal Tech...

01:02:59.335 --> 01:03:02.421
...where you worked on the
lanthanide-doped ruby maser...

01:03:02.629 --> 01:03:04.662
...dramatically increasing the

01:03:04.663 --> 01:03:06.967
sensitivity of
radio telescopes.

01:03:07.426 --> 01:03:09.109
Subsequently offered a teaching

01:03:09.110 --> 01:03:11.012
position at Harvard
University...

01:03:11.219 --> 01:03:14.306
...which you turned down
to pursue SETI work...

01:03:14.515 --> 01:03:17.934
...at the Arecibo
Observatory in Puerto Rico.

01:03:20.353 --> 01:03:22.857
Changes in N.S.F. policy...

01:03:23.231 --> 01:03:26.609
...gave rise to certain
funding problems...

01:03:27.694 --> 01:03:29.193
...at which point...

01:03:29.695 --> 01:03:31.657
...you came to my attention.

01:03:32.992 --> 01:03:35.325
You compromised
our security codes.

01:03:37.702 --> 01:03:39.537
Once upon a time...

01:03:41.539 --> 01:03:43.625
...I was a hell of an engineer.

01:03:43.959 --> 01:03:45.961
Please, sit, Doctor.

01:03:46.544 --> 01:03:48.480
I have guests so rarely, it's

01:03:48.482 --> 01:03:51.215
important they feel
welcome in my home.

01:03:52.258 --> 01:03:53.592
You live here?

01:03:55.217 --> 01:03:58.554
I find it convenient
to keep my interests...

01:03:59.890 --> 01:04:00.891
...mobile.

01:04:03.558 --> 01:04:07.730
Anyway, I've had my fill
of life on the ground.

01:04:09.482 --> 01:04:10.982
I guess I should...

01:04:11.649 --> 01:04:13.255
I guess I should thank you for

01:04:13.256 --> 01:04:15.237
having bailed me
out all that time.

01:04:20.577 --> 01:04:22.702
I know a good bet
when I see one.

01:04:25.079 --> 01:04:27.915
Earl Grey. No sugar,
no milk, I believe.

01:04:31.252 --> 01:04:33.088
What am I doing here?

01:04:43.471 --> 01:04:46.557
The powers that be have
been very busy lately...

01:04:47.392 --> 01:04:49.308
...positioning themselves...

01:04:49.476 --> 01:04:52.270
...for the game
of the millennium.

01:04:59.069 --> 01:05:01.697
Maybe I can help
deal you back in.

01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:05.367
I didn't realize
that I was out.

01:05:05.951 --> 01:05:07.828
No. Maybe not out...

01:05:08.953 --> 01:05:11.288
...but certainly
being handed your hat.

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:20.380
I've had a long time
to make enemies, Doctor.

01:05:23.925 --> 01:05:25.551
There are many governments...

01:05:25.759 --> 01:05:27.343
...business interests...

01:05:27.929 --> 01:05:30.015
...even religious
leaders that would

01:05:30.016 --> 01:05:31.932
like to see me
depart this earth.

01:05:33.434 --> 01:05:35.937
And I'll grant them
their wish soon enough.

01:05:36.478 --> 01:05:40.107
But before I do, I wish to
make a small contribution.

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:43.042
A final gesture
of goodwill to the

01:05:43.044 --> 01:05:45.447
people of this planet
who have given...

01:05:48.322 --> 01:05:50.990
...from whom I
have taken so much.

01:05:54.411 --> 01:05:55.912
You found the primer.

01:05:58.289 --> 01:05:59.457
Clever girl!

01:06:00.624 --> 01:06:01.376
Lights.

01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:12.719
Pages and pages of data.

01:06:13.345 --> 01:06:16.389
Over 63,000 in all.

01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:18.768
And on the perimeter of each...

01:06:18.977 --> 01:06:22.561
Alignment symbols, registration
marks, but they don't line up.

01:06:23.104 --> 01:06:24.269
They do...

01:06:24.562 --> 01:06:26.233
...if you think like a Vegan.

01:06:27.192 --> 01:06:30.153
An alien intelligence has
got be more advanced...

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:32.081
...and that means efficiency

01:06:32.082 --> 01:06:34.284
functioning on
multiple levels...

01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:36.408
...and in multiple...

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:38.410
...dimensions.

01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:44.373
Yes, of course!

01:06:44.958 --> 01:06:46.041
Where's the primer?

01:06:46.541 --> 01:06:47.835
You'll see.

01:06:48.417 --> 01:06:52.882
Every three-dimensional page
contains a piece of the primer.

01:06:55.050 --> 01:06:58.553
There it was all the time,
staring you in the face.

01:06:59.639 --> 01:07:01.340
Buried within the message

01:07:01.341 --> 01:07:03.724
itself is the key
to decoding it.

01:07:04.017 --> 01:07:05.786
Within the layering
of the matrix,

01:07:05.787 --> 01:07:07.351
we have these basic equations:

01:07:09.147 --> 01:07:11.372
So with this very
elementary foundation,

01:07:11.373 --> 01:07:13.109
they have given us a kind of...

01:07:13.316 --> 01:07:15.775
...general
scientific vocabulary.

01:07:15.988 --> 01:07:18.239
We now have the symbols
for true and false...

01:07:18.447 --> 01:07:19.782
This was the key...

01:07:19.989 --> 01:07:22.410
...that allowed us to
decipher their language...

01:07:22.659 --> 01:07:26.287
...for physics, geometry,
chemistry. Next frame, Ellie.

01:07:27.706 --> 01:07:31.499
Yes, and when we apply this
to the rest of the message...

01:07:32.416 --> 01:07:33.419
...we find this.

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.358
Those look like engineering

01:07:39.359 --> 01:07:41.386
schematics, almost
like blueprints.

01:07:42.761 --> 01:07:43.762
Yes.

01:07:44.053 --> 01:07:45.448
It is our belief that the

01:07:45.449 --> 01:07:47.347
message contains
instructions...

01:07:47.515 --> 01:07:51.019
...for building something,
some kind of machine.

01:07:51.393 --> 01:07:54.105
A machine? That
does what, Doctor?

01:07:54.439 --> 01:07:56.648
We don't know. It
might be some type...

01:07:57.605 --> 01:07:59.932
...of advanced
communication device,

01:07:59.933 --> 01:08:02.195
or a teaching
machine of some kind.

01:08:03.696 --> 01:08:05.031
Or it might be...

01:08:05.239 --> 01:08:06.991
...some kind of a transport.

01:08:07.408 --> 01:08:09.951
- Transport?
- There's no proof of that.

01:08:10.161 --> 01:08:13.747
The fact is you don't know what
it does. It could be anything.

01:08:14.038 --> 01:08:15.672
A Trojan Horse. We build it and

01:08:15.673 --> 01:08:17.459
out pours the
entire Vegan army.

01:08:17.751 --> 01:08:20.209
Why risk the personnel?
It could be a weapon.

01:08:20.419 --> 01:08:22.757
Right. Some kind of
a Doomsday Machine.

01:08:22.966 --> 01:08:25.382
Every time they detect
a new civilization...

01:08:25.591 --> 01:08:27.885
...they fax construction
plans from space.

01:08:28.136 --> 01:08:29.983
We poor saps build
this thing and

01:08:29.984 --> 01:08:31.723
blow ourselves to kingdom come.

01:08:31.973 --> 01:08:35.558
There's no reason to believe
their intentions are hostile.

01:08:35.976 --> 01:08:39.439
Why is it the egghead position
that aliens are always benign?

01:08:40.356 --> 01:08:41.941
We pose no threat to them.

01:08:42.148 --> 01:08:44.734
It'd be like us going
out of our way...

01:08:44.985 --> 01:08:46.695
...to destroy
microbes on an anthill.

01:08:46.903 --> 01:08:48.321
Interesting analogy.

01:08:48.946 --> 01:08:50.620
How guilty would we feel if we

01:08:50.621 --> 01:08:52.907
destroyed a few
microbes on an anthill?

01:08:53.074 --> 01:08:54.201
I hope you're right.

01:08:54.617 --> 01:08:55.618
I really do.

01:08:55.825 --> 01:08:57.235
But my job is to protect

01:08:57.235 --> 01:08:59.288
American lives
from any threat...

01:08:59.497 --> 01:09:01.625
...so I am obligated
to assume the worst.

01:09:01.832 --> 01:09:03.834
Yes, and I am forced
to agree with you.

01:09:04.043 --> 01:09:05.545
My problem is this:

01:09:06.171 --> 01:09:09.382
The content of that message
is morally ambiguous at best.

01:09:10.049 --> 01:09:11.915
Our internal
numbers show support

01:09:11.916 --> 01:09:13.510
for this is incredibly soft.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.388
If the President
stays this course...

01:09:16.554 --> 01:09:19.307
...his numbers will be going
south like ducks in winter.

01:09:19.599 --> 01:09:20.642
This is nuts!

01:09:20.891 --> 01:09:21.893
Excuse me...

01:09:22.103 --> 01:09:23.061
...Miss.

01:09:23.562 --> 01:09:26.064
We know nothing of
these creatures' values.

01:09:26.313 --> 01:09:28.900
We don't even know whether
they believe in God.

01:09:29.107 --> 01:09:30.859
This doesn't make
any sense. If...

01:09:31.069 --> 01:09:32.860
Excuse me, Dr. Arroway.

01:09:33.070 --> 01:09:35.572
We won't be suppressing
any opinions here today.

01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:38.533
No, of course
not. I understand.

01:09:39.535 --> 01:09:40.953
What I meant to say...

01:09:41.618 --> 01:09:44.788
...is the message was written
in the language of science.

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:46.792
If it was religious in nature,

01:09:46.793 --> 01:09:48.543
it should have
taken the form...

01:09:48.752 --> 01:09:51.420
...of a burning bush
or a voice from the sky.

01:09:51.629 --> 01:09:53.671
But a voice from the sky...

01:09:54.801 --> 01:09:57.342
...is exactly what you
found, Doctor Arroway.

01:10:01.054 --> 01:10:02.804
I'm sorry I'm late, ma'am.

01:10:04.476 --> 01:10:08.353
I agree with Mr. Rank that
there are unavoidable...

01:10:08.562 --> 01:10:10.731
...religious
implications at stake.

01:10:10.937 --> 01:10:13.357
But that doesn't justify
being an alarmist.

01:10:15.316 --> 01:10:17.736
I hope that we can
find a common ground...

01:10:18.152 --> 01:10:21.198
...break through obstacles
that may have kept us apart.

01:10:22.158 --> 01:10:24.575
Listen, I need to make
one thing very clear.

01:10:24.784 --> 01:10:27.285
Our organization
will not be placated

01:10:27.286 --> 01:10:29.457
with flowery New
Age rhetoric...

01:10:30.205 --> 01:10:30.956
Mr. President!

01:10:33.542 --> 01:10:35.668
The President met
with top advisors...

01:10:35.834 --> 01:10:39.172
...regarding the latest
efforts to decode the message.

01:10:39.381 --> 01:10:41.696
While there has
been some progress,

01:10:41.697 --> 01:10:44.011
the official line
remains cautious.

01:10:44.217 --> 01:10:46.347
If you're asking
when we'll find out...

01:10:46.513 --> 01:10:48.890
...what the purpose
of that Machine is...

01:10:49.890 --> 01:10:52.641
...maybe tomorrow, maybe
next year, maybe never.

01:10:57.063 --> 01:10:59.467
There he is. The
man with his finger

01:10:59.467 --> 01:11:01.611
on the nation's
spiritual pulse.

01:11:02.986 --> 01:11:04.654
It's so good to see you.

01:11:04.904 --> 01:11:05.945
You too.

01:11:07.657 --> 01:11:11.619
Your discovery, all of this.
It must be a real vindication.

01:11:12.287 --> 01:11:13.912
I'm really happy for you.

01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:15.579
Are you?

01:11:15.789 --> 01:11:18.211
Mr. Joss, the
President's waiting.

01:11:21.086 --> 01:11:22.587
The President's waiting.

01:11:26.967 --> 01:11:28.468
See you at the reception?

01:11:29.135 --> 01:11:30.803
Yeah, I wouldn't miss it.

01:11:42.937 --> 01:11:45.232
Miss Constantine,
may I speak to you?

01:11:45.441 --> 01:11:46.817
Certainly.

01:11:48.610 --> 01:11:50.237
I have a big problem.

01:11:52.615 --> 01:11:55.242
Do you know where I can
find a really great dress?

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.506
God created man in the form of

01:12:16.507 --> 01:12:18.721
Himself, not in
the form of monkeys!

01:12:27.439 --> 01:12:29.857
Get a job! Don't
waste my tax dollars!

01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:57.965
You look beautiful, Ellie.

01:12:59.677 --> 01:13:01.968
- So do you.
- You really do.

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:07.141
I read your book.

01:13:08.059 --> 01:13:09.309
Here we go.

01:13:09.727 --> 01:13:11.270
You want me to quote you?

01:13:12.063 --> 01:13:13.313
"Ironically...

01:13:13.647 --> 01:13:15.608
...the thing people
are most hungry for...

01:13:15.858 --> 01:13:17.109
...meaning...

01:13:17.318 --> 01:13:18.775
...is the one thing science

01:13:18.776 --> 01:13:20.612
hasn't been able
to give them. "

01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:21.819
Yeah.

01:13:24.157 --> 01:13:26.117
It's like you're saying that...

01:13:26.410 --> 01:13:28.787
...science killed God.

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:32.000
What if science
simply revealed...

01:13:32.582 --> 01:13:35.001
...that He never existed
in the first place?

01:13:38.502 --> 01:13:40.671
I think we need
to get some air.

01:13:41.673 --> 01:13:43.465
And a few more of these.

01:13:45.051 --> 01:13:46.219
Thank you.

01:13:48.218 --> 01:13:49.682
A little chilly out here.

01:13:49.931 --> 01:13:51.348
Yeah, this is nice.

01:13:51.723 --> 01:13:52.890
I got one for you.

01:13:53.141 --> 01:13:54.810
Occam's Razor.
Ever heard of it?

01:13:55.059 --> 01:13:57.688
Occam's Razor. Sounds
like some slasher movie.

01:13:57.938 --> 01:13:59.557
No, Occam's Razor is a basic

01:13:59.558 --> 01:14:01.524
scientific
principle which says:

01:14:01.899 --> 01:14:03.597
Things being
equal, the simplest

01:14:03.598 --> 01:14:05.196
explanation tends to be right.

01:14:05.447 --> 01:14:06.739
Makes sense to me.

01:14:07.196 --> 01:14:08.322
So what's more likely?

01:14:08.532 --> 01:14:09.490
Thank you.

01:14:10.116 --> 01:14:12.785
An all-powerful God
created the universe...

01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:15.914
...then decided not to give
any proof of His existence?

01:14:16.121 --> 01:14:17.205
Or...

01:14:17.497 --> 01:14:20.710
...that He doesn't exist at
all and that we created Him...

01:14:20.959 --> 01:14:23.502
...so we wouldn't feel
so small and alone.

01:14:24.463 --> 01:14:25.546
I don't know.

01:14:25.838 --> 01:14:29.798
I couldn't imagine living in
a world where God didn't exist.

01:14:30.635 --> 01:14:32.177
I wouldn't want to.

01:14:32.802 --> 01:14:35.180
How do you know you're
not deluding yourself?

01:14:36.054 --> 01:14:37.182
I mean, for me...

01:14:37.348 --> 01:14:39.185
...I'd need proof.

01:14:40.186 --> 01:14:41.187
Proof?

01:14:44.395 --> 01:14:46.065
Did you love your father?

01:14:47.151 --> 01:14:48.860
Your dad, did you love him?

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:52.197
Yes. Very much.

01:14:55.701 --> 01:14:56.868
Prove it.

01:15:03.957 --> 01:15:04.999
Kent.

01:15:05.749 --> 01:15:07.168
The White House.

01:15:10.253 --> 01:15:12.347
No excuses.
Whoever's responsible,

01:15:12.348 --> 01:15:14.257
I want their head on a platter.

01:15:14.549 --> 01:15:15.759
What happened?

01:15:16.425 --> 01:15:17.842
You were right all along.

01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:21.014
The team at the VLA has
worked around the clock...

01:15:21.223 --> 01:15:23.682
...and the hard work
has finally paid off.

01:15:24.267 --> 01:15:26.191
This key section
uncovered tonight,

01:15:26.192 --> 01:15:28.063
and obtained
exclusively by CNN...

01:15:28.228 --> 01:15:30.815
...shows an illustration
of a human figure...

01:15:31.067 --> 01:15:33.900
...inside a geometric
structure of some kind.

01:15:34.068 --> 01:15:35.944
This and other
contextual clues...

01:15:36.194 --> 01:15:37.393
...now lead scientists to

01:15:37.394 --> 01:15:39.115
believe the message
is, in fact...

01:15:39.366 --> 01:15:41.609
- President called
an emergency meeting.

01:15:41.610 --> 01:15:42.867
- I imagined he would.

01:15:43.119 --> 01:15:46.204
...designed to take a single
human occupant into space...

01:15:46.663 --> 01:15:48.957
...presumably to the star Vega.

01:16:12.602 --> 01:16:13.812
Tell me.

01:16:14.354 --> 01:16:15.398
They will build it.

01:16:15.648 --> 01:16:16.440
Who goes?

01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:18.503
The President's
gone international

01:16:18.504 --> 01:16:20.111
to spread the risk and cost...

01:16:20.361 --> 01:16:21.237
Who goes?

01:16:22.028 --> 01:16:23.697
Well, it's complicated.

01:16:25.114 --> 01:16:28.576
They have formed a group
of international candidates.

01:16:28.826 --> 01:16:30.785
Now, it's your discovery.

01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:32.924
They understand that. You're

01:16:32.925 --> 01:16:34.913
at the top of a
very short list.

01:16:35.330 --> 01:16:37.836
But they're also forming
a selection committee.

01:16:38.084 --> 01:16:40.430
It's made of
scholars, theologians,

01:16:40.431 --> 01:16:42.253
scientists, philosophers...

01:16:42.462 --> 01:16:43.044
You're on it.

01:16:44.589 --> 01:16:45.881
I've been asked, yes.

01:16:48.842 --> 01:16:50.469
I guess that means...

01:16:51.094 --> 01:16:53.931
...that you're a selector,
I'm a selectee and we can't...

01:16:54.181 --> 01:16:55.265
Yeah.

01:16:55.475 --> 01:16:57.767
What you don't
understand, Ellie, is...

01:16:58.101 --> 01:16:59.310
I understand.

01:17:00.855 --> 01:17:02.579
I want you to know, whatever

01:17:02.579 --> 01:17:04.858
happens, as far
as I'm concerned...

01:17:08.443 --> 01:17:09.695
Good luck.

01:17:13.989 --> 01:17:15.595
Whatever you do, make sure he

01:17:15.596 --> 01:17:17.536
doesn't monopolize
the committee.

01:17:17.743 --> 01:17:19.746
He is not on the
committee, Ellie.

01:17:23.749 --> 01:17:26.754
He just resigned. He
wants to be the one to go.

01:17:28.962 --> 01:17:32.256
The President is already
feeling the financial pinch.

01:17:32.422 --> 01:17:35.676
Sources say the cost of
the project is spiralling...

01:17:35.886 --> 01:17:38.596
...to more than a third
of a trillion dollars...

01:17:38.806 --> 01:17:40.269
...making this perhaps the

01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:42.182
most expensive
single project...

01:17:42.352 --> 01:17:44.227
...in all of human history.

01:17:44.477 --> 01:17:46.479
Months of debate
finally reached...

01:17:46.645 --> 01:17:48.541
...a conclusion last week as 10

01:17:48.542 --> 01:17:51.109
candidates were
selected by the I.M.C...

01:17:51.566 --> 01:17:53.289
...representing a cross section

01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:55.237
of political and
religious views.

01:17:55.445 --> 01:17:58.030
Many are the same experts
who have consulted...

01:17:58.281 --> 01:18:00.534
...on the Machine's
design and function.

01:18:00.742 --> 01:18:03.049
They will actively
participate on-site,

01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:04.953
during the
construction process.

01:18:05.453 --> 01:18:06.624
The choice of these 10

01:18:06.625 --> 01:18:08.542
candidates has
been controversial.

01:18:08.749 --> 01:18:11.585
One-third of the
candidates are American.

01:18:11.794 --> 01:18:14.546
And many international
observers ask why.

01:18:15.089 --> 01:18:17.674
The U.S. is shouldering
a large part of the cost...

01:18:17.883 --> 01:18:20.843
Isn't it true that contractors,
like Hadden Industries...

01:18:21.052 --> 01:18:24.348
...are making contributions in
exchange for technology rights?

01:18:24.597 --> 01:18:28.100
Different nations are being
compensated in different ways.

01:18:28.308 --> 01:18:30.549
Japan made headlines
by opting to

01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:32.855
forego candidate
representation...

01:18:33.147 --> 01:18:36.274
...in exchange for the systems
integration subcontract.

01:18:36.524 --> 01:18:38.232
On what basis do you choose...

01:18:38.443 --> 01:18:41.320
...a human being to
represent humanity?

01:18:41.529 --> 01:18:42.654
Good question, Larry.

01:18:42.863 --> 01:18:44.615
If nothing else...

01:18:45.031 --> 01:18:46.926
...it should be
somebody fluent in

01:18:46.927 --> 01:18:49.034
the language the
message was given in.

01:18:49.204 --> 01:18:50.455
Science, in this case.

01:18:51.039 --> 01:18:53.456
Despite your
obvious enthusiasm...

01:18:53.666 --> 01:18:55.874
...there's been a
lot of criticism...

01:18:56.124 --> 01:18:58.754
...that this endeavor
is simply too dangerous.

01:18:58.964 --> 01:19:01.380
Some of that criticism
from scientists.

01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:04.382
One Nobel Prize winner
noted, his words:

01:19:05.176 --> 01:19:06.886
"There is every indication...

01:19:07.096 --> 01:19:09.226
...that this is beyond
our capabilities,

01:19:09.227 --> 01:19:10.890
that this endeavor will fail...

01:19:11.098 --> 01:19:12.900
...and that the
Machine's occupant

01:19:12.901 --> 01:19:14.602
will pay for it
with his life. "

01:19:14.808 --> 01:19:16.561
How do you respond?

01:19:16.770 --> 01:19:18.008
This message is from a

01:19:18.009 --> 01:19:20.147
civilization that
may be anywhere...

01:19:20.356 --> 01:19:22.269
...from hundreds
to millions and

01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:24.069
millions of years ahead of us.

01:19:24.319 --> 01:19:27.487
I have to believe that an
intelligence that advanced...

01:19:28.112 --> 01:19:29.781
...knows what they're doing.

01:19:31.242 --> 01:19:34.577
Now all it requires
on our part is...

01:19:35.245 --> 01:19:36.205
Faith?

01:19:39.292 --> 01:19:41.376
I was going to say,
a sense of adventure.

01:19:41.586 --> 01:19:43.045
And in breaking news...

01:19:43.252 --> 01:19:44.670
...astronaut John Russell...

01:19:44.879 --> 01:19:46.976
...considered to be
the leading American

01:19:46.977 --> 01:19:48.716
candidate for the
Machine seat...

01:19:48.926 --> 01:19:51.217
...has dropped
out of the running.

01:19:51.635 --> 01:19:54.679
Russell met with reporters
today at his Houston home.

01:19:55.098 --> 01:19:57.182
I told my dad I
didn't want him...

01:19:57.932 --> 01:19:59.016
...to go.

01:19:59.225 --> 01:20:00.684
Daddy, don't go.

01:20:03.604 --> 01:20:05.356
Nothing would give
me more pride...

01:20:05.564 --> 01:20:06.690
...than to...

01:20:07.358 --> 01:20:09.359
...represent my country.

01:20:09.693 --> 01:20:11.403
But what can I say to this?

01:20:12.318 --> 01:20:16.074
Consortium officials had no
comment, but inside sources...

01:20:16.282 --> 01:20:18.242
...have disclosed
that Dr. Arroway...

01:20:18.450 --> 01:20:20.052
...appears to now be the

01:20:20.053 --> 01:20:22.456
front-runner for
the Machine seat.

01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:25.959
"Meet me at noon. Must talk. "

01:20:26.292 --> 01:20:28.586
I didn't expect a message
like this from you.

01:20:28.752 --> 01:20:30.088
Thanks for coming.

01:20:30.295 --> 01:20:33.257
Is this kosher?
Fraternizing with the enemy?

01:20:33.465 --> 01:20:36.592
Selectors and selectees
mingling around?

01:20:37.134 --> 01:20:38.929
Can we talk about Einstein?

01:20:39.469 --> 01:20:41.054
Yeah, sure.

01:20:41.763 --> 01:20:44.975
Special relativity.
This Machine...

01:20:46.518 --> 01:20:50.606
...if it works, you travel
to Vega at the speed of light.

01:20:50.814 --> 01:20:52.982
- When you come back...
- If you come back.

01:20:55.318 --> 01:20:56.986
If you come back...

01:20:57.487 --> 01:20:59.564
...you'll be 4
years older, but over

01:20:59.565 --> 01:21:01.866
50 years will have
passed here on Earth.

01:21:01.949 --> 01:21:03.325
Basically.

01:21:04.161 --> 01:21:06.662
And everybody that
you care about...

01:21:07.663 --> 01:21:09.956
...will be gone,
dead and buried.

01:21:10.831 --> 01:21:14.503
If you came back, if
you survived at all...

01:21:16.130 --> 01:21:19.923
Look, Palmer, nobody's
saying this isn't dangerous.

01:21:20.134 --> 01:21:22.302
The rest of the
candidates and myself

01:21:22.304 --> 01:21:24.302
understand the
risks we're taking.

01:21:24.469 --> 01:21:25.428
Why?

01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:28.432
It's a historic opportunity.
The world needs...

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:31.310
You, Ellie. You!
You personally.

01:21:32.312 --> 01:21:35.104
By doing this, you're
willing to give your life.

01:21:35.314 --> 01:21:37.484
You're willing to die for it.

01:21:39.317 --> 01:21:40.525
Why?

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:48.034
From as long as I can remember,
I've been searching for...

01:21:48.701 --> 01:21:50.326
...something...

01:21:50.578 --> 01:21:52.258
...some reason why we're here.

01:21:52.259 --> 01:21:54.334
What are we doing
here? Who are we?

01:21:55.334 --> 01:21:59.211
If this is a chance to find out
even a part of that answer...

01:22:00.711 --> 01:22:03.715
I don't know, I think
it's worth a human life.

01:22:04.422 --> 01:22:05.549
Don't you?

01:22:12.430 --> 01:22:15.100
You're an incredibly
brave woman, Ellie.

01:22:17.853 --> 01:22:19.728
Or incredibly nuts.

01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:51.300
I'm really confused.

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:53.884
So am I.

01:22:55.095 --> 01:22:58.723
I think I speak for us all when
I thank you for your patience.

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:02.394
Myself, I have one final
question, Dr. Arroway.

01:23:03.935 --> 01:23:06.229
If you should meet
these Vegans...

01:23:06.437 --> 01:23:10.775
...and were permitted only
one question to ask of them...

01:23:10.942 --> 01:23:12.611
...what would it be?

01:23:14.155 --> 01:23:15.988
I suppose it would be:

01:23:16.237 --> 01:23:17.908
"How did you do it?

01:23:18.491 --> 01:23:20.477
How did you evolve? How did you

01:23:20.478 --> 01:23:22.911
survive technological
adolescence...

01:23:23.077 --> 01:23:25.040
...without
destroying yourself?"

01:23:25.748 --> 01:23:28.154
That more than any
other question is

01:23:28.155 --> 01:23:30.626
one I personally
would like answered.

01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:32.794
Not too bad, Mike.

01:23:33.505 --> 01:23:34.757
I join Dr. Bergeron...

01:23:34.964 --> 01:23:38.426
...in expressing thanks for
your patience, Dr. Arroway.

01:23:38.592 --> 01:23:41.135
We're all impressed
with your candor...

01:23:41.473 --> 01:23:43.014
...and your stamina.

01:23:43.473 --> 01:23:46.851
I think we're ready to move
on to your final statement.

01:23:47.017 --> 01:23:48.936
I have one more question.

01:23:49.144 --> 01:23:50.688
Yes, Mr. Joss.

01:23:54.690 --> 01:23:57.026
Would you consider yourself...

01:23:57.526 --> 01:23:59.863
...a spiritual person?

01:24:05.327 --> 01:24:07.536
I don't understand the
point of the question.

01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:11.663
I consider myself
a moral person.

01:24:11.831 --> 01:24:13.992
We're sure that's the case, but

01:24:13.993 --> 01:24:16.503
what Mr. Joss is
in fact asking...

01:24:16.628 --> 01:24:18.504
Do you believe in God?

01:24:27.012 --> 01:24:29.181
As a scientist...

01:24:29.514 --> 01:24:33.018
...I rely on empirical
evidence, and in this matter...

01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:36.688
...I don't believe that
there's data either way.

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:41.485
So your answer would in fact be
that you don't believe in God.

01:24:45.363 --> 01:24:48.408
I don't understand the
relevance of the question.

01:24:51.367 --> 01:24:54.371
95% of the world's
population...

01:24:54.579 --> 01:24:58.374
...believes in a Supreme
Being in one form or another.

01:24:59.543 --> 01:25:02.712
I believe that makes the
question more than relevant.

01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:18.685
I believe...

01:25:23.065 --> 01:25:25.608
I believe I've already
answered that question.

01:25:29.610 --> 01:25:33.031
I'm proud of what we've
achieved as a species...

01:25:33.281 --> 01:25:35.284
...and as a civilization.

01:25:36.908 --> 01:25:39.579
I would hate to see
everything we stand for...

01:25:39.746 --> 01:25:43.541
...all that we have fought for
for a thousand generations...

01:25:43.708 --> 01:25:46.083
...all that God has
blessed us with...

01:25:47.463 --> 01:25:48.963
...betrayed...

01:25:49.921 --> 01:25:52.146
...in the final
hour because we sent

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:54.549
a representative who
did not put our...

01:25:55.094 --> 01:25:57.803
...most cherished
beliefs first.

01:26:01.099 --> 01:26:02.266
Thank you.

01:26:35.504 --> 01:26:36.841
Why'd you do it?

01:26:41.426 --> 01:26:45.557
Our job was to select someone
to speak for everybody.

01:26:48.976 --> 01:26:52.186
I couldn't in good conscience
vote for a person...

01:26:52.479 --> 01:26:54.481
...who doesn't believe in God.

01:26:56.525 --> 01:26:57.941
Someone who...

01:26:58.359 --> 01:27:01.485
...honestly thinks
the other 95% of us...

01:27:01.694 --> 01:27:04.489
...suffer from some
form of mass delusion.

01:27:07.826 --> 01:27:09.910
I told the truth up there.

01:27:11.205 --> 01:27:14.666
Drumlin told you exactly
what you wanted to hear.

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:52.491
With full humility
and utmost gratitude...

01:27:52.702 --> 01:27:54.827
...I accept this great honor...

01:27:55.037 --> 01:27:59.082
...and I promise I will do my
best to represent my nation...

01:27:59.248 --> 01:28:02.754
...my planet and my
God on this historic...

01:28:02.918 --> 01:28:04.003
...journey.

01:28:04.545 --> 01:28:06.880
I thank you from the
bottom of my heart.

01:28:49.461 --> 01:28:52.464
There's a carnival atmosphere
at Cape Canaveral...

01:28:52.631 --> 01:28:54.758
...as the International
Machine Consortium...

01:28:54.966 --> 01:28:58.301
...hosts as much a media
event as a systems test.

01:28:58.763 --> 01:29:00.418
David Drumlin is supervising

01:29:00.419 --> 01:29:02.429
the on-site
portion of the test.

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.473
We spoke with
him earlier today.

01:29:04.767 --> 01:29:07.116
We'll be able to
monitor the stresses

01:29:07.117 --> 01:29:09.646
and effects using
the robot passenger...

01:29:10.147 --> 01:29:12.440
...who we lovingly call Elmer.

01:29:18.195 --> 01:29:20.656
The press wants to ask
you a few questions...

01:29:20.907 --> 01:29:23.532
...as soon as they're
done with Dr. Drumlin.

01:29:26.122 --> 01:29:28.549
When we release the
pod, a substantial

01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:30.790
amount of energy
will be generated.

01:29:31.623 --> 01:29:34.210
We'll be able to monitor
the stresses and effects...

01:29:34.461 --> 01:29:36.796
...using our robot
passenger, who we...

01:29:37.089 --> 01:29:39.131
...lovingly call Elmer.

01:29:39.757 --> 01:29:40.759
Thank you.

01:29:41.008 --> 01:29:42.301
You're welcome.

01:29:43.677 --> 01:29:45.971
They're ready for
you out at the site.

01:29:46.638 --> 01:29:48.304
Yeah, just a minute.

01:29:54.312 --> 01:29:56.646
- Congratulations.
- Glad you could come.

01:29:58.025 --> 01:30:00.359
Didn't expect to see you here.

01:30:01.152 --> 01:30:02.985
Well, I'm still...

01:30:03.321 --> 01:30:05.990
...Crew Ops at
the Control Center.

01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:08.799
I suppose the fact
that I discovered

01:30:08.799 --> 01:30:10.785
the message means
I have PR value.

01:30:10.995 --> 01:30:12.329
Of course.

01:30:14.124 --> 01:30:17.250
I know you must think
this is all very unfair.

01:30:17.876 --> 01:30:19.835
And maybe that's
an understatement.

01:30:21.337 --> 01:30:23.630
What you don't
know is, I agree.

01:30:24.173 --> 01:30:25.636
I wish the world was a place

01:30:25.637 --> 01:30:27.467
where fair was
the bottom line...

01:30:27.634 --> 01:30:29.354
...where the
idealism you showed

01:30:29.355 --> 01:30:30.972
at the hearing was rewarded...

01:30:31.221 --> 01:30:33.348
...not taken advantage of.

01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:37.851
Unfortunately, we don't
live in that world.

01:30:40.188 --> 01:30:41.314
Funny...

01:30:42.732 --> 01:30:45.901
...I always believed the
world is what we make of it.

01:30:47.944 --> 01:30:48.738
Excuse me!

01:30:52.699 --> 01:30:54.200
Good luck on the test.

01:30:54.909 --> 01:30:56.079
Thank you.

01:31:04.627 --> 01:31:05.669
Test director...

01:31:05.878 --> 01:31:08.129
...everything looks
good. Ready to go.

01:31:08.588 --> 01:31:11.675
I want things double
and triple checked here.

01:31:11.881 --> 01:31:15.135
We only get one shot at
this. Let's get it right.

01:31:15.594 --> 01:31:18.682
Ladies and gentlemen, we
are ready for start-up.

01:31:18.931 --> 01:31:22.268
All controllers, I need a
go-no-go for test initiation.

01:31:22.393 --> 01:31:23.394
- Mechanical?
- Go.

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:24.561
Electrical?

01:31:24.728 --> 01:31:25.812
Dynamics?

01:31:26.063 --> 01:31:27.230
Communications?

01:31:27.397 --> 01:31:28.522
Pod systems?

01:31:28.771 --> 01:31:29.942
Safety?

01:31:30.402 --> 01:31:33.237
Crew Ops, verify all pre-test
procedures are complete.

01:31:33.444 --> 01:31:34.945
Yes, verified. I'm go.

01:31:35.114 --> 01:31:37.617
Pad Leader, is
everything okay with you?

01:31:37.784 --> 01:31:40.411
Roger. The pad is a go.

01:31:40.618 --> 01:31:43.413
Test initiation, on my mark.

01:31:43.870 --> 01:31:45.081
5...

01:31:45.454 --> 01:31:46.623
...4...

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:48.250
...3...

01:31:48.457 --> 01:31:49.458
...2...

01:31:50.043 --> 01:31:51.086
...1.

01:31:51.626 --> 01:31:52.753
Mark.

01:31:53.295 --> 01:31:55.132
- Test start.
- Rings are unlocked.

01:31:55.299 --> 01:31:56.841
Power levels show a good start.

01:31:57.092 --> 01:31:58.843
We've begun the test of...

01:31:59.093 --> 01:32:01.468
...earth's first
system built by sharing

01:32:01.469 --> 01:32:03.556
knowledge with a
neighbor in space.

01:32:03.764 --> 01:32:06.057
All power sources on
core induction bus.

01:32:06.266 --> 01:32:07.976
IPV power transfer.

01:32:08.184 --> 01:32:11.314
Ring motion detect.
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie.

01:32:12.939 --> 01:32:15.984
- Gerry, how are we looking?
- Looks good. We're underway.

01:32:16.151 --> 01:32:17.986
Looks like a normal start-up.

01:32:18.152 --> 01:32:20.489
Roger, David. It's
looking good here.

01:32:26.075 --> 01:32:27.622
We are moments away from the

01:32:27.623 --> 01:32:29.495
initiation of
the drop sequence.

01:32:29.662 --> 01:32:31.456
All systems are go.

01:32:34.458 --> 01:32:36.253
- Mechanical, you still happy?
- Roger.

01:32:36.461 --> 01:32:37.712
It's very exciting...

01:32:37.919 --> 01:32:39.503
...from up here.

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:43.593
We've got 4%.

01:32:43.799 --> 01:32:45.595
We're confirming 4%.

01:32:46.845 --> 01:32:49.473
Frequency 9.85.

01:32:50.474 --> 01:32:52.473
Harmonics in the green.

01:32:52.727 --> 01:32:55.063
G-level 1.1.

01:32:56.187 --> 01:32:59.565
- 5%.
- Confirmed. We are at 5%.

01:32:59.815 --> 01:33:01.360
David, how's it looking to you?

01:33:01.693 --> 01:33:04.654
Okay. I'm going to take a
look and show you what we got.

01:33:04.863 --> 01:33:06.654
Instrumentation looks good.

01:33:06.864 --> 01:33:10.325
We have a good picture
from Dr. Drumlin's PRD.

01:33:10.867 --> 01:33:13.327
Hope you guys are
seeing what I'm seeing.

01:33:13.828 --> 01:33:15.664
All systems are go.

01:33:17.246 --> 01:33:18.751
This is really something!

01:33:18.959 --> 01:33:20.542
For purposes of this test...

01:33:20.794 --> 01:33:22.912
...Dr. Drumlin will
be on top of the

01:33:22.914 --> 01:33:25.087
Gantry crane that's
over the Machine.

01:33:25.339 --> 01:33:27.342
We've got some
video animation...

01:33:27.508 --> 01:33:29.477
...to show just
how this Machine...

01:33:29.478 --> 01:33:31.010
it is thought... will work.

01:33:31.261 --> 01:33:32.886
The passenger pod will release.

01:33:33.097 --> 01:33:35.272
It will come down
through the center of

01:33:35.273 --> 01:33:37.393
the rings and into
the Machine's core.

01:33:37.684 --> 01:33:40.018
The question everyone
here is asking is...

01:33:40.227 --> 01:33:41.728
...what happens then?

01:33:42.062 --> 01:33:44.428
Some believe the
rings function as some

01:33:44.429 --> 01:33:46.733
sort of an accelerator
or something...

01:33:47.527 --> 01:33:49.653
...sending its
energy into the pod...

01:33:49.861 --> 01:33:52.364
...making it rocket
away at near light speed.

01:33:52.572 --> 01:33:54.616
Others believe it might open up

01:33:54.618 --> 01:33:56.993
a doorway to some
other dimension.

01:33:57.368 --> 01:33:58.368
Who's right?

01:33:58.577 --> 01:34:01.037
That's what today's
test is all about.

01:34:01.454 --> 01:34:03.582
- 35%.
- Subsystems ready?

01:34:03.749 --> 01:34:05.709
40% normal acceleration.

01:34:05.917 --> 01:34:07.251
Confirm 40%.

01:34:07.459 --> 01:34:10.423
Controllers stand by to
initiate drop sequence...

01:34:10.588 --> 01:34:12.215
...on my mark.

01:34:12.423 --> 01:34:14.550
All systems ready
for drop sequence.

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:16.387
45%.

01:34:17.262 --> 01:34:19.388
We're in 45%.

01:34:20.348 --> 01:34:22.391
Verify closure.

01:34:23.727 --> 01:34:25.060
46.

01:34:25.437 --> 01:34:27.979
All controllers
stand by to initiate

01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:30.106
IPV drop sequence. On my mark.

01:34:30.774 --> 01:34:32.108
48%.

01:34:33.442 --> 01:34:35.569
I'm feeling a very
strange vibration.

01:34:36.029 --> 01:34:37.709
- Are you feeling
it down there?

01:34:37.710 --> 01:34:39.032
- Gerry, can you confirm?

01:34:39.614 --> 01:34:40.906
Everything looks good.

01:34:41.617 --> 01:34:42.620
Crew Ops?

01:34:42.785 --> 01:34:43.703
Nothing wrong.

01:34:43.869 --> 01:34:45.536
We see nothing abnormal here.

01:34:45.746 --> 01:34:48.622
No good. Hold sequence.
I'll take a direct reading.

01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:50.459
What's he talking about?

01:34:50.667 --> 01:34:52.335
Can anyone say grandstanding?

01:34:52.628 --> 01:34:54.587
He sure knows he's on TV!

01:34:54.838 --> 01:34:57.800
Back home that's what we
call an overcooked ham.

01:34:58.259 --> 01:35:00.427
I'm reading 10 kilohertz!

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:03.553
What do you read on the first
and second order G-levels?

01:35:03.762 --> 01:35:05.389
G-levels are right on!

01:35:07.266 --> 01:35:10.143
We confirm Drumlin's
readings. All normal. We're go.

01:35:11.437 --> 01:35:14.104
I think we're okay, but
we'll let him finish.

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:18.775
- Mechanical, you still okay?
- Roger. Right on the money.

01:35:19.192 --> 01:35:20.400
Security problem!

01:35:21.779 --> 01:35:23.446
Ellie, are you sure?

01:35:24.032 --> 01:35:25.657
He shouldn't be
there. I know him.

01:35:25.866 --> 01:35:28.660
Gerry, execute the
rapid shutdown sequence.

01:35:28.952 --> 01:35:32.164
Security, move emergency
response team into position.

01:35:32.373 --> 01:35:34.208
Get Drumlin on a secure loop.

01:35:34.499 --> 01:35:35.834
You got him.

01:35:36.042 --> 01:35:38.543
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, I hear.

01:35:38.962 --> 01:35:41.129
We've got a
security breach here.

01:35:41.506 --> 01:35:42.464
Behind you.

01:35:42.673 --> 01:35:43.590
The tall guy.

01:35:44.008 --> 01:35:45.341
The technician.

01:35:45.677 --> 01:35:46.802
See him?

01:35:49.305 --> 01:35:50.515
He shouldn't be there.

01:35:56.645 --> 01:35:58.020
Something's in his hand!

01:35:59.187 --> 01:36:02.022
Him! Take him! Security breach!

01:36:02.358 --> 01:36:03.191
A bomb!

01:36:03.525 --> 01:36:06.862
I want that emergency response
team up on the gantry. Now!

01:36:07.195 --> 01:36:08.197
Stage One Alert!

01:36:08.363 --> 01:36:11.156
Move all fire and rescue
personnel into position one.

01:36:49.401 --> 01:36:51.527
All right, back
to your stations.

01:36:51.737 --> 01:36:54.824
I need you to be
professional. Settle down!

01:36:55.033 --> 01:36:57.533
Pad Leader, do you copy?

01:37:15.468 --> 01:37:18.010
The scene earlier today,
when David Drumlin...

01:37:18.218 --> 01:37:20.096
...advisor to two Presidents...

01:37:20.304 --> 01:37:21.921
...and winner of the National

01:37:21.922 --> 01:37:24.099
Academy of Sciences
lifetime award...

01:37:24.432 --> 01:37:28.147
...was laid to rest at
Arlington National Cemetery.

01:37:31.981 --> 01:37:33.690
In a related story...

01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:35.232
Can I help you?

01:37:37.236 --> 01:37:39.112
I've got some mail for you.

01:37:39.572 --> 01:37:41.764
...the apparent
suicide note of the

01:37:41.765 --> 01:37:44.077
terrorist now
believed responsible...

01:37:44.283 --> 01:37:47.247
...for the explosion
in Florida this week.

01:37:47.622 --> 01:37:49.122
What we do...

01:37:49.456 --> 01:37:52.416
...we do for the
goodness of all mankind.

01:37:53.124 --> 01:37:55.962
This won't be
understood, not now...

01:37:56.462 --> 01:37:58.131
...but the
Apocalypse to come...

01:37:59.257 --> 01:38:01.465
...will vindicate our faith.

01:38:25.781 --> 01:38:26.658
Welcome home.

01:39:33.386 --> 01:39:34.844
Comrade Arroway...

01:39:35.888 --> 01:39:39.264
...we have been expecting
your call. One moment, please.

01:39:48.981 --> 01:39:50.193
Mr. Hadden?

01:39:50.817 --> 01:39:52.110
Doctor!

01:39:53.236 --> 01:39:55.072
How kind of you to call.

01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:57.741
Mr. Hadden, where are you?

01:39:59.910 --> 01:40:02.404
The Russian government
was kind enough

01:40:02.405 --> 01:40:04.580
to give me
accommodations on Mir.

01:40:05.538 --> 01:40:07.415
You're living on
a space station?

01:40:08.749 --> 01:40:10.709
It's quite simple, really.

01:40:12.170 --> 01:40:15.631
The low oxygen, zero
gravity environment...

01:40:15.882 --> 01:40:17.990
...is the only thing keeping

01:40:17.991 --> 01:40:20.552
the cancer from
eating me alive.

01:40:22.177 --> 01:40:24.848
Actually, I quite
like it up here.

01:40:25.391 --> 01:40:28.559
My little room has
one hell of a view.

01:40:36.693 --> 01:40:38.527
I want to show you something.

01:40:43.156 --> 01:40:45.159
Hokkaido Island.

01:40:46.535 --> 01:40:48.788
The systems integration site.

01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:51.455
Look closer.

01:40:59.754 --> 01:41:02.591
First rule in
government spending:

01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:07.429
Why build one when you can
have two at twice the price?

01:41:07.806 --> 01:41:10.807
Only, this one
can be kept secret.

01:41:11.433 --> 01:41:13.433
Controlled by Americans...

01:41:13.895 --> 01:41:17.229
...built by Japanese
subcontractors...

01:41:18.189 --> 01:41:20.858
...who also happen to be...

01:41:21.815 --> 01:41:23.486
...recently acquired...

01:41:24.028 --> 01:41:26.488
...wholly-owned
subsidiaries...

01:41:27.323 --> 01:41:29.324
...of Hadden Industries.

01:41:32.952 --> 01:41:36.120
They still want an
American to go, Doctor.

01:41:39.877 --> 01:41:41.501
Want to take a ride?

01:42:24.122 --> 01:42:26.124
Augmenting our restraint and...

01:42:26.376 --> 01:42:28.501
...communications
console subsystem...

01:42:28.668 --> 01:42:30.672
...is your personal
recording unit.

01:42:30.964 --> 01:42:34.466
Normal, infrared and
ultraviolet lenses.

01:42:35.134 --> 01:42:36.848
Digital microchip good for

01:42:36.849 --> 01:42:39.096
thousands of
hours of recording.

01:42:40.389 --> 01:42:42.558
Okay, look, I understand...

01:42:42.808 --> 01:42:46.144
...the reason for recording
and documenting the mission.

01:42:46.312 --> 01:42:48.897
But I just want to go
on record one more time.

01:42:49.147 --> 01:42:50.697
The transmitted specs never

01:42:50.698 --> 01:42:52.650
said anything
about any chair...

01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:54.777
...or a restraining harness...

01:42:54.987 --> 01:42:56.988
...or survival gear.

01:42:57.696 --> 01:42:59.490
Why can't we just
trust the original...

01:42:59.697 --> 01:43:01.758
Doctor, both the
IMC Board and the

01:43:01.759 --> 01:43:03.703
SI team reviewed
the material...

01:43:03.869 --> 01:43:07.413
...and concluded that the
design impact is negligible.

01:43:07.789 --> 01:43:09.331
Bottom line is...

01:43:09.916 --> 01:43:12.043
...we're not putting anyone
aboard this Machine...

01:43:12.251 --> 01:43:15.255
...unless there is some
sort of minimal protection.

01:43:15.589 --> 01:43:16.922
End of story.

01:43:23.928 --> 01:43:25.875
We've given these
to the astronauts

01:43:25.876 --> 01:43:27.933
since the start of
the space program.

01:43:29.267 --> 01:43:31.562
It's never been made
public, of course.

01:43:31.770 --> 01:43:33.855
It's fast and it's painless.

01:43:36.607 --> 01:43:39.610
I'm going to travel 26 light
years to commit suicide?

01:43:39.859 --> 01:43:41.527
Something may go wrong.

01:43:42.112 --> 01:43:44.781
There may be an unforeseen
mechanical failure.

01:43:45.532 --> 01:43:48.618
You could be marooned,
unable to return.

01:43:49.784 --> 01:43:52.915
There are 1,000 reasons we
can think of to have this...

01:43:53.123 --> 01:43:56.043
...but mostly it's for the
reasons we can't think of.

01:44:22.565 --> 01:44:23.733
Come in.

01:44:25.234 --> 01:44:27.571
Dr. Arroway, time to get ready.

01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:28.822
Thank you.

01:44:39.914 --> 01:44:41.667
I know there's not much time.

01:44:41.832 --> 01:44:44.880
As soon as I found out about
it, I called the President.

01:44:45.087 --> 01:44:46.755
I came with Kitz.

01:44:47.338 --> 01:44:49.590
I had to see you one more time.

01:44:49.839 --> 01:44:51.510
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

01:44:51.928 --> 01:44:53.678
No, I'm glad you came.

01:44:53.929 --> 01:44:56.181
There's something
I got to say to you.

01:44:57.515 --> 01:44:59.492
The reason I
didn't vote for you

01:44:59.493 --> 01:45:01.768
was a good one, but
not the real one.

01:45:02.853 --> 01:45:04.853
I didn't vote for you to go...

01:45:06.731 --> 01:45:08.566
...because I don't
want to lose you.

01:45:09.693 --> 01:45:11.860
Now you find your
way home, all right?

01:45:28.835 --> 01:45:30.254
23 hours ago, the world...

01:45:30.504 --> 01:45:32.439
...was stunned by
the announcement

01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.591
of the existence of
another Machine...

01:45:34.799 --> 01:45:37.760
...and its passenger,
Eleanor Ann Arroway.

01:45:37.969 --> 01:45:38.553
Now...

01:45:39.177 --> 01:45:41.597
...the question that's
on everyone's mind:

01:45:41.805 --> 01:45:43.556
Will history repeat itself?

01:45:43.973 --> 01:45:46.310
With a piece of
engineering this complex...

01:45:46.476 --> 01:45:50.522
...with so many unknowns,
could the unthinkable occur?

01:45:50.731 --> 01:45:54.066
The security in Hokkaido
has been incredibly tight.

01:45:54.233 --> 01:45:57.613
No reporters whatsoever have
been allowed near the site.

01:48:38.133 --> 01:48:41.136
Restraint secure. Life
support functions normal.

01:48:41.344 --> 01:48:42.220
Roger.

01:48:42.429 --> 01:48:44.429
This is Control. Do you copy?

01:48:44.641 --> 01:48:46.141
Reading you
five-by-five.

01:48:47.183 --> 01:48:48.601
Give me Ellie's PRD.

01:48:48.852 --> 01:48:50.854
Video unit recording
and transmitting.

01:48:52.231 --> 01:48:54.815
- Are you reading me?
- That's affirmative.

01:48:55.025 --> 01:48:56.692
Video looks good.

01:48:57.527 --> 01:48:58.652
Copy, Control.

01:49:00.070 --> 01:49:02.865
Ellie, we're going to
proceed to button you up.

01:49:04.741 --> 01:49:05.909
I'm ready.

01:49:09.747 --> 01:49:11.622
Confirming walkway retraction.

01:49:12.331 --> 01:49:13.749
- Communications?
- Go.

01:49:13.916 --> 01:49:15.917
- Life support?
- Go.

01:49:16.292 --> 01:49:17.668
We are go for closure.

01:49:20.088 --> 01:49:21.715
I'm go here.

01:49:22.799 --> 01:49:26.305
Mechanical, initiate
IPV closure sequence.

01:49:27.972 --> 01:49:29.639
Let me get you a chair.

01:49:32.098 --> 01:49:34.745
- It's nice to smell
you again, Mr. Kitz.

01:49:34.746 --> 01:49:35.436
- You too.

01:49:36.187 --> 01:49:38.021
Wouldn't peg him as a Polo man.

01:49:47.364 --> 01:49:48.863
I got a visual on the door.

01:49:51.283 --> 01:49:53.119
The door is looking good.

01:49:58.372 --> 01:50:00.043
Door alignment looks good.

01:50:29.236 --> 01:50:30.738
We're green across the board.

01:50:31.029 --> 01:50:33.531
Copy that, Control.
IPV is secure.

01:50:41.369 --> 01:50:43.040
We are at 30%.

01:50:43.540 --> 01:50:44.832
Copy that, 30%.

01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:51.173
How you doing in there?

01:50:51.631 --> 01:50:52.382
Kent?

01:50:53.257 --> 01:50:54.008
Is that you?

01:50:54.425 --> 01:50:56.009
That's a big affirmative.

01:50:56.843 --> 01:50:58.389
Who let you in there?

01:50:58.721 --> 01:51:00.724
A higher power intervened.

01:51:02.768 --> 01:51:04.184
I'm glad you came.

01:51:08.813 --> 01:51:10.066
35%.

01:51:10.774 --> 01:51:12.150
Copy that, 35%.

01:51:12.442 --> 01:51:13.859
- Mechanical?
- We're good.

01:51:14.069 --> 01:51:15.444
40%.

01:51:18.905 --> 01:51:20.866
I'm picking up a
moderate vibration.

01:51:22.117 --> 01:51:24.119
Dynamics, can you
confirm vibration?

01:51:24.328 --> 01:51:25.580
It looks good here.

01:51:25.788 --> 01:51:28.955
She's feeling the same
thing they felt at the Cape.

01:51:29.164 --> 01:51:30.249
Vibration's normal.

01:51:30.958 --> 01:51:33.378
We are at 50%. All
systems nominal.

01:51:33.627 --> 01:51:35.462
Copy that, 50%.

01:51:40.927 --> 01:51:42.803
Vibration's a
little stronger now.

01:51:43.136 --> 01:51:45.472
We're picking up some
low frequency noise.

01:51:46.306 --> 01:51:47.764
Mechanical, confirm?

01:51:47.973 --> 01:51:49.435
It looks fine to me.

01:51:49.643 --> 01:51:51.769
Roger. Jerry,
what do you think?

01:51:51.978 --> 01:51:52.813
I'm still go.

01:51:53.105 --> 01:51:54.606
People, we are still go.

01:51:57.441 --> 01:51:58.942
Something's happening.

01:52:02.987 --> 01:52:04.487
You see that light?

01:52:04.654 --> 01:52:05.782
I'm seeing...

01:52:09.034 --> 01:52:10.995
I can't tell if it's daylight.

01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:14.332
There it is again. It's
coming from the bottom.

01:52:15.792 --> 01:52:17.376
Let me show you. See that?

01:52:17.626 --> 01:52:19.794
Negative. You're breaking up.

01:52:20.168 --> 01:52:22.297
- Can we boost signal?
- It's at maximum.

01:52:22.798 --> 01:52:24.091
65%.

01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:25.967
The material is changing.

01:52:26.176 --> 01:52:29.636
It's bordering on translucence.
The system's intact.

01:52:32.973 --> 01:52:34.516
It has to be...

01:52:34.726 --> 01:52:37.269
...some kind of
electromagnetic field.

01:52:37.518 --> 01:52:38.563
Do you read this?

01:52:38.813 --> 01:52:40.815
We see only interference.

01:52:40.857 --> 01:52:42.356
It's becoming translucent.

01:52:43.233 --> 01:52:45.735
I can't describe it. I
can't even explain it!

01:52:48.530 --> 01:52:49.488
70%.

01:52:49.696 --> 01:52:52.033
We have intermittent
comm, but we are go!

01:52:52.366 --> 01:52:54.367
Initiate secondary
drive systems.

01:52:54.576 --> 01:52:56.662
Initiating auxiliary
booster sequence.

01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:58.413
We're go for ignition.

01:53:05.755 --> 01:53:07.339
We have auxiliary ignition.

01:53:13.886 --> 01:53:15.388
Life support, how is she?

01:53:15.555 --> 01:53:18.432
Heart and respiration are
high but within limits.

01:53:18.723 --> 01:53:20.058
Ellie, do you copy?

01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:21.268
If you hear...

01:53:21.393 --> 01:53:23.312
...I am okay to go.

01:53:31.985 --> 01:53:33.238
80%.

01:53:33.488 --> 01:53:36.322
All vibration and
G-levels are in the green.

01:53:41.787 --> 01:53:43.955
Control, if you're
reading me...

01:53:44.247 --> 01:53:46.459
...I am okay to go! Okay to go!

01:53:46.792 --> 01:53:47.751
85%.

01:53:47.917 --> 01:53:49.336
All tips are on the profile.

01:53:51.588 --> 01:53:54.591
90%. We're detecting some
structural instability.

01:53:55.716 --> 01:53:58.594
- Is she holding?
- We're within limits, barely.

01:54:00.095 --> 01:54:02.056
I'm okay to go!

01:54:04.056 --> 01:54:05.724
I'm okay to go!

01:54:11.981 --> 01:54:13.441
My God!

01:54:24.449 --> 01:54:25.869
Okay to go!

01:54:26.034 --> 01:54:27.080
I'm okay!

01:54:27.372 --> 01:54:28.873
100% target velocity.

01:54:30.415 --> 01:54:32.702
Tremendous EMI
levels around Machine!

01:54:32.703 --> 01:54:34.750
Field measurements
are off-scale.

01:54:34.959 --> 01:54:37.297
We're approaching
our abort limits.

01:54:39.799 --> 01:54:40.925
Okay to go.

01:54:46.097 --> 01:54:46.929
I hear her!

01:54:47.472 --> 01:54:50.388
I hear her. Barely,
but she's there.

01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:51.806
Okay to go.

01:54:52.186 --> 01:54:53.561
Says she's okay to go.

01:54:56.606 --> 01:54:58.440
Steve, we're real close.

01:54:58.772 --> 01:54:59.808
- Your core reading?

01:54:59.809 --> 01:55:01.777
- Internal environment
looks normal.

01:55:02.153 --> 01:55:04.863
Inside the core, the
weather's beautiful.

01:55:08.951 --> 01:55:10.242
I'm okay to go.

01:55:12.746 --> 01:55:14.206
I'm okay to go.

01:55:14.748 --> 01:55:16.081
Initiate drop sequence.

01:55:19.668 --> 01:55:21.420
On my mark.

01:55:22.046 --> 01:55:23.047
10...

01:55:23.588 --> 01:55:24.632
...9...

01:55:25.633 --> 01:55:26.633
...8...

01:55:28.175 --> 01:55:29.177
...7...

01:55:29.552 --> 01:55:30.553
...6...

01:55:31.178 --> 01:55:32.178
...5...

01:55:32.471 --> 01:55:33.471
...4...

01:55:34.016 --> 01:55:34.599
...3...

01:55:35.558 --> 01:55:36.517
...2...

01:55:36.725 --> 01:55:37.809
I'm okay to go.

01:55:42.107 --> 01:55:43.774
Oh, God!

01:55:53.324 --> 01:55:54.951
Ellie to Control.

01:55:55.701 --> 01:55:58.161
Ellie to Control,
do you read me!

01:56:02.832 --> 01:56:05.168
Ellie to Control,
do you read me!

01:56:11.382 --> 01:56:12.508
I'll try...

01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:14.760
...to keep recording!

01:56:15.555 --> 01:56:17.179
I'm going through...

01:56:17.387 --> 01:56:19.389
...some kind of a tunnel!

01:56:34.820 --> 01:56:36.364
There's a light source ahead!

01:56:36.990 --> 01:56:38.072
Brilliant...

01:56:38.283 --> 01:56:39.658
...blue-white.

01:56:41.327 --> 01:56:42.913
Residual radiation?

01:56:54.628 --> 01:56:55.921
It's a star.

01:56:56.507 --> 01:56:57.634
I must have...

01:56:58.426 --> 01:56:59.926
...gone through a wormhole.

01:57:05.096 --> 01:57:06.434
It's Vega!

01:57:17.610 --> 01:57:19.361
I'm in another wormhole now!

01:57:23.032 --> 01:57:24.116
I had no idea!

01:57:24.365 --> 01:57:25.950
A series of them!

01:57:28.913 --> 01:57:30.039
They're alive.

01:57:30.329 --> 01:57:31.456
It's like...

01:57:31.874 --> 01:57:34.291
...some kind of
a transit system.

01:57:35.292 --> 01:57:36.667
A subway!

01:57:36.835 --> 01:57:38.211
Oh, God!

01:57:43.967 --> 01:57:45.884
I have to keep talking.

01:57:48.972 --> 01:57:50.264
It's a triple...

01:57:50.474 --> 01:57:52.725
...no, a quadruple system.

01:57:53.266 --> 01:57:54.350
Beautiful!

01:57:57.688 --> 01:57:58.940
They're alive!

01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:08.949
Another wormhole!

01:58:09.281 --> 01:58:11.075
This one's much more violent!

01:59:44.704 --> 01:59:45.705
Some...

01:59:47.121 --> 01:59:48.788
...celestial event...

01:59:50.248 --> 01:59:51.248
No!

01:59:52.124 --> 01:59:53.753
No words!

01:59:54.130 --> 01:59:55.795
No words...

01:59:57.465 --> 01:59:59.133
...to describe it!

02:00:01.261 --> 02:00:02.762
Poetry!

02:00:04.262 --> 02:00:05.805
They should have sent...

02:00:06.473 --> 02:00:07.640
...a poet.

02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:09.644
It's so beautiful!

02:00:10.936 --> 02:00:12.144
Beautiful!

02:00:13.981 --> 02:00:15.815
So beautiful.

02:00:20.318 --> 02:00:22.820
I had no idea.

02:03:02.342 --> 02:03:03.635
Hi, Sparks.

02:03:05.512 --> 02:03:06.513
Dad?

02:03:14.479 --> 02:03:16.146
I missed you.

02:03:22.154 --> 02:03:23.154
Aren't you...?

02:03:23.319 --> 02:03:26.156
I'm sorry I couldn't be
there for you, sweetheart.

02:03:36.332 --> 02:03:37.707
You're not real.

02:03:39.711 --> 02:03:41.170
None of this is real!

02:03:41.379 --> 02:03:43.130
That's my scientist.

02:03:44.506 --> 02:03:46.288
When I was unconscious, you

02:03:46.289 --> 02:03:48.800
downloaded my
thoughts, my memories.

02:03:49.801 --> 02:03:51.179
Pensacola!

02:03:54.388 --> 02:03:56.850
We thought it might make
things easier for you.

02:04:10.696 --> 02:04:12.115
Why did you contact us?

02:04:12.324 --> 02:04:14.035
You contacted us.

02:04:14.534 --> 02:04:16.161
We were just listening.

02:04:16.994 --> 02:04:18.327
There are others?

02:04:18.619 --> 02:04:19.787
Many others.

02:04:24.919 --> 02:04:26.170
They all...

02:04:26.627 --> 02:04:29.756
...travel here through that
transit system you built?

02:04:30.297 --> 02:04:31.757
We didn't build it.

02:04:32.924 --> 02:04:34.468
We don't know who did.

02:04:36.554 --> 02:04:39.222
They were gone long
before we ever got here.

02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:41.975
Maybe someday
they'll come back.

02:04:42.975 --> 02:04:45.478
All the civilizations
you find come here?

02:04:45.688 --> 02:04:46.979
Not all.

02:04:48.731 --> 02:04:51.899
- Is this some test?
- No, no test.

02:04:54.821 --> 02:04:56.364
You have your mother's hands.

02:05:06.580 --> 02:05:08.749
You're an
interesting species...

02:05:09.416 --> 02:05:11.043
...an interesting mix.

02:05:12.336 --> 02:05:15.088
You're capable of such
beautiful dreams...

02:05:16.132 --> 02:05:18.256
...and such
horrible nightmares.

02:05:19.719 --> 02:05:21.553
You feel so lost...

02:05:22.345 --> 02:05:24.847
...so cut off, so alone.

02:05:26.555 --> 02:05:27.934
Only you're not.

02:05:32.396 --> 02:05:34.063
In all our searching...

02:05:34.274 --> 02:05:37.193
...all we've found that makes
the emptiness bearable...

02:05:37.943 --> 02:05:39.319
...is each other.

02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:44.950
What happens now?

02:05:46.241 --> 02:05:47.369
Now?

02:05:48.704 --> 02:05:50.204
You go home.

02:05:50.705 --> 02:05:51.790
Home?

02:05:52.289 --> 02:05:53.374
But...

02:05:53.874 --> 02:05:55.334
...I have so many questions.

02:05:55.709 --> 02:05:57.377
Do we get to come back?

02:05:58.501 --> 02:06:00.339
This was just a first step.

02:06:00.881 --> 02:06:02.674
In time, you'll take another.

02:06:04.259 --> 02:06:06.802
But other people need
to see what I've seen...

02:06:07.010 --> 02:06:10.015
This is the way it's been
done for billions of years.

02:06:12.391 --> 02:06:14.059
Small moves, Ellie.

02:06:15.893 --> 02:06:17.563
Small moves.

02:07:01.103 --> 02:07:02.729
We've got video on Ellie!

02:07:02.938 --> 02:07:04.897
She's through!
She is in the net.

02:07:05.106 --> 02:07:07.525
She's alive. Get the
President on the phone!

02:07:08.318 --> 02:07:09.819
What's going on? How is she?

02:07:10.694 --> 02:07:12.405
Ellie, this is
Control. You copy?

02:07:12.613 --> 02:07:14.073
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

02:07:14.781 --> 02:07:16.409
- She's alive.
- Put her on P.A.

02:07:16.617 --> 02:07:18.200
Ellie, hold on tight.

02:07:18.786 --> 02:07:20.375
We're still trying to determine

02:07:20.376 --> 02:07:22.120
the nature of
the malfunction...

02:07:22.371 --> 02:07:24.874
...but the important
thing is you're okay.

02:07:25.125 --> 02:07:26.126
What?

02:07:26.458 --> 02:07:27.919
It's all right.

02:07:28.128 --> 02:07:30.045
The important thing
is you're safe.

02:07:31.046 --> 02:07:32.799
What malfunction?

02:07:37.261 --> 02:07:38.594
What happened?

02:07:40.219 --> 02:07:41.723
What day is this?

02:07:42.558 --> 02:07:43.516
I'm sorry.

02:07:43.724 --> 02:07:45.226
Did you say what day?

02:07:46.812 --> 02:07:48.395
How long was I gone?

02:07:50.648 --> 02:07:54.819
The IPV dropped straight
through the Machine.

02:07:55.735 --> 02:07:57.487
You didn't go anywhere.

02:07:58.239 --> 02:07:59.572
But I did.

02:07:59.822 --> 02:08:01.157
I did go.

02:08:01.657 --> 02:08:03.826
That's what I've
tried to tell everyone.

02:08:08.497 --> 02:08:11.081
But the headset didn't
record a single image?

02:08:11.749 --> 02:08:13.085
Just this.

02:08:13.332 --> 02:08:14.377
Static.

02:08:14.587 --> 02:08:15.588
Thank you.

02:08:17.005 --> 02:08:18.756
Let me show you what we saw.

02:08:28.766 --> 02:08:32.436
43 separate remote cameras
show exactly the same event.

02:08:32.687 --> 02:08:34.135
The IPV dropped straight

02:08:34.136 --> 02:08:36.190
through. Everyone
saw exactly...

02:08:36.524 --> 02:08:37.858
...the same thing.

02:08:38.274 --> 02:08:39.693
Nothing happened.

02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:43.363
How do you explain
this, Doctor?

02:08:45.614 --> 02:08:46.739
I can't.

02:08:46.989 --> 02:08:48.451
I'd encourage you...

02:08:50.203 --> 02:08:52.413
...not to inflame
this situation...

02:08:52.622 --> 02:08:54.415
...beyond the facts.

02:08:54.623 --> 02:08:57.835
Let us deal with
this on the facts.

02:08:58.126 --> 02:09:01.046
We are monitoring what
has actually happened.

02:09:01.295 --> 02:09:04.340
We are taking what we
believe are factually...

02:09:04.592 --> 02:09:06.593
...appropriate steps.

02:09:06.843 --> 02:09:09.888
Amid a flurry of accusations
and counter-accusations...

02:09:10.097 --> 02:09:12.724
...by the nations representing
the Machine Consortium...

02:09:12.933 --> 02:09:15.767
...the President has
ordered a special inquiry.

02:09:15.977 --> 02:09:18.771
But the appointment to the
committee of Michael Kitz...

02:09:18.978 --> 02:09:21.815
...who has resigned as
National Security Advisor...

02:09:22.023 --> 02:09:24.483
...has raised eyebrows
on Capitol Hill.

02:09:24.691 --> 02:09:26.533
I have made no
decision to run for

02:09:26.534 --> 02:09:28.320
Congress, announced
no candidacy.

02:09:28.569 --> 02:09:31.908
I resigned as National
Security Advisor...

02:09:32.075 --> 02:09:36.243
...in order to devote all
of my energy to this inquiry.

02:09:36.992 --> 02:09:39.105
The people of the world have a

02:09:39.106 --> 02:09:41.707
right to know what
really happened.

02:09:42.501 --> 02:09:45.127
Yet every scientific
instrument confirms...

02:09:45.335 --> 02:09:47.180
...the IPV was out of contact

02:09:47.181 --> 02:09:49.340
for only a fraction
of a second.

02:09:49.550 --> 02:09:51.340
Isn't that correct, Doctor?

02:09:53.260 --> 02:09:55.595
A fraction of a
second Earth time, yes.

02:09:56.471 --> 02:09:57.764
Earth time?

02:09:58.014 --> 02:10:01.518
Senator, I believe that the
Machine opened up a wormhole...

02:10:01.851 --> 02:10:04.218
...a tunnel through
space-time, also

02:10:04.219 --> 02:10:06.521
known as an
Einstein-Rossen Bridge.

02:10:06.773 --> 02:10:09.074
Due to the effect of
general relativity,

02:10:09.075 --> 02:10:10.986
what I experienced
as 18 hours...

02:10:11.234 --> 02:10:13.445
...passed
instantaneously on Earth.

02:10:13.695 --> 02:10:15.780
Isn't it true
these wormholes are

02:10:15.781 --> 02:10:17.740
merely theoretical predictions?

02:10:18.116 --> 02:10:20.786
There is no evidence
they actually exist?

02:10:20.994 --> 02:10:22.745
There is no direct
evidence, no.

02:10:22.955 --> 02:10:24.121
Tell me...

02:10:24.662 --> 02:10:27.625
...why would these aliens
go to all this trouble?

02:10:28.127 --> 02:10:30.227
Bring you thousands
of light years,

02:10:30.228 --> 02:10:32.213
then send you
home without proof?

02:10:32.881 --> 02:10:35.676
They said it's how it's been
done for billions of years.

02:10:36.135 --> 02:10:39.512
You have no proof because they
didn't want you to have any.

02:10:39.803 --> 02:10:41.967
A phenomenon known
in psychiatric

02:10:41.968 --> 02:10:44.515
circles as a
self-reinforcing delusion.

02:10:45.184 --> 02:10:46.641
You think I was delusional?

02:10:46.850 --> 02:10:48.846
I do think you
may have suffered

02:10:48.847 --> 02:10:51.020
some kind of an
episode. Yes, I do.

02:10:51.271 --> 02:10:54.066
I'd like to propose an
alternate hypothesis...

02:10:54.274 --> 02:10:56.057
...and I'd like
you to bring your

02:10:56.058 --> 02:10:57.944
scientific expertise
to bear on it.

02:10:58.193 --> 02:11:01.157
To fake a signal from Vega...

02:11:01.991 --> 02:11:03.283
...what would you need?

02:11:05.243 --> 02:11:07.046
You'd need a
satellite to transmit

02:11:07.047 --> 02:11:08.952
it, but it would
be impossible to...

02:11:09.165 --> 02:11:10.880
You'd need a satellite and

02:11:10.882 --> 02:11:13.125
launch capabilities
to orbit it.

02:11:13.334 --> 02:11:16.670
And the message itself. To put
something like this together...

02:11:16.795 --> 02:11:19.130
...so complex, drawing
on many disciplines...

02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:20.673
Would be impossible.

02:11:22.510 --> 02:11:23.968
Impossible?

02:11:24.511 --> 02:11:27.472
Is there anyone who might
have been up to the challenge?

02:11:28.347 --> 02:11:30.808
Someone with extraordinary
technical expertise...

02:11:31.141 --> 02:11:33.142
...enormous
financial resources...

02:11:33.559 --> 02:11:35.748
...someone perverse
enough, eccentric

02:11:35.749 --> 02:11:37.647
enough to come
up with the idea?

02:11:39.357 --> 02:11:40.150
Hadden?

02:11:41.235 --> 02:11:43.195
S. R. Hadden.

02:11:47.824 --> 02:11:49.448
You're implying
that this was...

02:11:49.699 --> 02:11:52.162
...some kind of a hoax?
That he engineered this?

02:11:52.370 --> 02:11:53.745
S. R. Hadden...

02:11:54.038 --> 02:11:56.021
...a legendary power broker in

02:11:56.022 --> 02:11:58.666
perhaps his final
bid for immortality.

02:11:58.874 --> 02:12:01.629
Maybe he wanted to
exploit new technologies...

02:12:01.796 --> 02:12:03.922
...having world
governments pick up the tab.

02:12:04.130 --> 02:12:06.882
Perhaps this was his
final altruistic gesture...

02:12:07.173 --> 02:12:08.746
...to unite the world in some

02:12:08.747 --> 02:12:10.802
common goal. Maybe
all of the above.

02:12:11.177 --> 02:12:13.346
S. R. Hadden, a brilliant...

02:12:13.889 --> 02:12:15.639
...and complicated man.

02:12:18.476 --> 02:12:22.272
Doctor, are you familiar
with the scientific precept...

02:12:22.937 --> 02:12:25.108
...known as Occam's Razor?

02:12:31.237 --> 02:12:32.405
Yes.

02:12:34.408 --> 02:12:36.645
It means the
simplest explanation

02:12:36.646 --> 02:12:39.078
generally tends to
be the right one.

02:12:39.245 --> 02:12:40.371
Exactly.

02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:43.583
You tell me. What
is more likely here?

02:12:43.790 --> 02:12:47.087
A message from aliens results
in a magical machine...

02:12:47.296 --> 02:12:50.006
...that whisks you to the
center of the galaxy...

02:12:50.256 --> 02:12:53.091
...to windsurf with Dad
and a split second later...

02:12:53.258 --> 02:12:56.761
...returns you home without
a single shred of proof?

02:12:57.218 --> 02:13:00.639
Or that your experience
is the result of being...

02:13:00.890 --> 02:13:04.269
...the unwitting star in the
farewell performance of one...

02:13:04.435 --> 02:13:05.395
...S.R. Hadden?

02:13:05.602 --> 02:13:09.315
A man with the means and motive
to play you and all of us...

02:13:09.524 --> 02:13:11.776
...as pawns in
the most elaborate,

02:13:11.777 --> 02:13:13.901
most expensive
hoax of all time?

02:13:18.866 --> 02:13:22.534
You come to us with no
evidence, no records...

02:13:23.244 --> 02:13:24.997
...no artifacts...

02:13:25.413 --> 02:13:29.540
...only a story that, to put
it mildly, strains credibility.

02:13:30.833 --> 02:13:33.795
Over half a trillion
dollars were spent.

02:13:34.129 --> 02:13:36.632
Dozens of lives were lost.

02:13:37.715 --> 02:13:39.937
Are you going to
sit there and tell

02:13:39.937 --> 02:13:42.095
us we should just
take this all...

02:13:43.138 --> 02:13:44.596
...on faith?

02:13:48.601 --> 02:13:50.602
Please answer the
question, Doctor.

02:13:54.731 --> 02:13:56.943
Is it possible that
it didn't happen?

02:13:57.151 --> 02:13:58.235
Yes.

02:14:01.070 --> 02:14:04.196
As a scientist I must concede
that. I must volunteer that.

02:14:08.745 --> 02:14:10.038
Let me get this straight.

02:14:10.497 --> 02:14:14.458
You admit you have no physical
evidence to back up your story?

02:14:14.958 --> 02:14:15.875
Yes.

02:14:16.084 --> 02:14:19.129
You admit you may have
hallucinated this whole thing?

02:14:19.878 --> 02:14:22.215
You admit if you were
in our position...

02:14:22.424 --> 02:14:25.969
...you would be as incredulous
and skeptical as we?

02:14:27.512 --> 02:14:29.646
Then why don't
you simply withdraw

02:14:29.647 --> 02:14:31.473
your testimony and concede...

02:14:31.766 --> 02:14:33.900
...that this
journey to the center

02:14:33.901 --> 02:14:35.852
of the galaxy never took place?

02:14:38.856 --> 02:14:40.690
Because I can't.

02:14:47.614 --> 02:14:50.283
I had an experience.

02:14:52.701 --> 02:14:55.328
I can't prove it. I
can't even explain it.

02:14:55.537 --> 02:14:58.497
But everything I know as a
human being, everything I am...

02:14:58.706 --> 02:15:00.834
...tells me it was real.

02:15:03.254 --> 02:15:04.952
I was given
something wonderful,

02:15:04.953 --> 02:15:06.756
something that
changed me forever.

02:15:07.047 --> 02:15:08.047
A vision...

02:15:08.715 --> 02:15:10.341
...of the universe...

02:15:11.049 --> 02:15:13.219
...that tells us undeniably...

02:15:13.722 --> 02:15:16.056
...how tiny and
insignificant...

02:15:16.223 --> 02:15:19.853
...and how rare and
precious we all are.

02:15:21.020 --> 02:15:24.064
A vision that tells us that
we belong to something...

02:15:24.355 --> 02:15:26.991
...that is greater
than ourselves,

02:15:26.992 --> 02:15:29.027
that none of us are alone.

02:15:33.906 --> 02:15:36.908
I wish I could share that.

02:15:40.411 --> 02:15:41.579
I wish...

02:15:43.204 --> 02:15:45.707
...that everyone,
if even for one...

02:15:46.043 --> 02:15:47.209
...moment...

02:15:47.417 --> 02:15:48.752
...could feel...

02:15:49.212 --> 02:15:52.215
...that awe and
humility and hope.

02:16:01.599 --> 02:16:03.893
That continues to be my wish.

02:16:45.138 --> 02:16:47.725
Dr. Arroway, can I
get a picture, please.

02:17:29.763 --> 02:17:30.889
Reverend Joss!

02:17:31.096 --> 02:17:32.722
What do you believe?!

02:17:38.645 --> 02:17:40.646
As a person of
faith, I'm bound by a

02:17:40.647 --> 02:17:42.647
different covenant
than Dr. Arroway.

02:17:44.399 --> 02:17:46.651
But our goal is
one and the same.

02:17:47.194 --> 02:17:48.820
The pursuit of truth.

02:17:52.325 --> 02:17:53.658
I, for one, believe her.

02:18:17.181 --> 02:18:20.100
So what happens now?
We give her a medal?

02:18:20.518 --> 02:18:22.935
I'd say at least
a healthy grant.

02:18:23.313 --> 02:18:24.995
You read the
confidential report

02:18:24.996 --> 02:18:26.730
from the investigating
committee?

02:18:26.939 --> 02:18:28.356
I flipped through it.

02:18:28.857 --> 02:18:30.796
I was very interested in the

02:18:30.797 --> 02:18:33.154
section on
Arroway's video unit.

02:18:33.904 --> 02:18:36.198
The one that
recorded the static.

02:18:37.447 --> 02:18:38.825
Continue.

02:18:39.825 --> 02:18:43.204
The fact that it recorded
static isn't what interests me.

02:18:48.461 --> 02:18:49.837
Continue.

02:18:50.753 --> 02:18:52.588
What interests me...

02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:56.590
...is that it recorded
approximately 18 hours of it.

02:19:01.804 --> 02:19:03.723
That is interesting, isn't it?

02:19:10.396 --> 02:19:12.477
And you can see
over there, we're

02:19:12.478 --> 02:19:14.316
building 45 brand new dishes.

02:19:14.608 --> 02:19:16.661
That means when you
put them together

02:19:16.663 --> 02:19:18.445
with all the
radio telescopes...

02:19:18.610 --> 02:19:20.113
...all over the world...

02:19:20.279 --> 02:19:22.384
...we'll hear
farther into space

02:19:22.385 --> 02:19:24.616
than anyone has
ever heard before.

02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:29.121
Are there other people
out there in the universe?

02:19:30.037 --> 02:19:31.458
That's a good question.

02:19:31.708 --> 02:19:32.875
What do you think?

02:19:33.500 --> 02:19:34.459
I don't know.

02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:36.461
That's a good answer.

02:19:37.796 --> 02:19:38.798
Skeptic, huh?

02:19:40.007 --> 02:19:42.249
The important thing
is that you all

02:19:42.250 --> 02:19:44.553
keep searching for
your own answers.

02:19:45.053 --> 02:19:47.139
One thing about the
universe, though.

02:19:48.056 --> 02:19:49.307
The universe...

02:19:49.764 --> 02:19:51.932
...is a pretty big place.

02:19:52.934 --> 02:19:55.313
It's bigger than anything...

02:19:55.605 --> 02:19:58.439
...anyone has ever
dreamed of before.

02:20:00.066 --> 02:20:01.692
So if it's just us...

02:20:03.530 --> 02:20:05.738
...it seems like an
awful waste of space.

02:20:07.656 --> 02:20:08.656
Right?
